    * ```ts
    * const folder = vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders?.[0];
    * if (folder) {
    *
    *   // Match any TypeScript file in the root of this workspace folder

    *   const pattern2 = new vscode.RelativePattern(folder, 'someFolder/ *.ts');
    * }
    * ```
    *

    * to pass in a {@link WorkspaceFolder workspace folder} if the pattern should match inside the workspace.
    * Otherwise, a uri or string should only be used if the pattern is for a file path outside the workspace.
    * @param pattern A file glob pattern like `*.{ts,js}` that will be matched on paths relative to the base.
