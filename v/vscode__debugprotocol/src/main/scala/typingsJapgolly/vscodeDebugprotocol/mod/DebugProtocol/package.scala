/** Event message for 'initialized' event type.
		This event indicates that the debug adapter is ready to accept configuration requests (e.g. SetBreakpointsRequest, SetExceptionBreakpointsRequest).
		A debug adapter is expected to send this event when it is ready to accept configuration requests (but not before the `initialize` request has finished).
		The sequence of events/requests is as follows:
		- adapters sends `initialized` event (after the `initialize` request has returned)
		- client sends zero or more `setBreakpoints` requests
		- client sends one `setFunctionBreakpoints` request (if corresponding capability `supportsFunctionBreakpoints` is true)
		- client sends a `setExceptionBreakpoints` request if one or more `exceptionBreakpointFilters` have been defined (or if `supportsConfigurationDoneRequest` is not true)
		- client sends other future configuration requests
		- client sends one `configurationDone` request to indicate the end of the configuration.
