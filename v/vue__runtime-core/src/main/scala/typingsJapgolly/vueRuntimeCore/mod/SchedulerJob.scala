    * Indicates whether the effect is allowed to recursively trigger itself
    * when managed by the scheduler.
    *
    * By default, a job cannot trigger itself because some built-in method calls,
    * e.g. Array.prototype.push actually performs reads as well (#1740) which
    * can lead to confusing infinite loops.
    * The allowed cases are component update functions and watch callbacks.
    * Component update functions may update child component props, which in turn
    * trigger flush: "pre" watch callbacks that mutates state that the parent
    * relies on (#1801). Watch callbacks doesn't track its dependencies so if it
    * triggers itself again, it's likely intentional and it is the user's
    * responsibility to perform recursive state mutation that eventually
    * stabilizes (#1727).
