/**
  * An EntityReference can be used in scenarios where a component has one or more properties that
  * refer to entities in the scene graph. Using an EntityReference simplifies the job of dealing
  * with the presence or non-presence of the underlying entity and its components, especially when
  * it comes to dealing with the runtime addition or removal of components, and addition/removal of
  * associated event listeners.
  *
  * ## Usage Scenario ##
  *
  * Imagine that you're creating a Checkbox component, which has a reference to an entity
  * representing the checkmark/tickmark that is rendered in the Checkbox. The reference is modeled
  * as an entity guid property on the Checkbox component, called simply 'checkmark'. We have to
  * implement a basic piece of functionality whereby when the 'checkmark' entity reference is set,
  * the Checkbox component must toggle the tint of an ImageElementComponent present on the checkmark
  * entity to indicate whether the Checkbox is currently in the active or inactive state.
  *
  * Without using an EntityReference, the Checkbox component must implement some or all of the
  * following:
  *
  * - Listen for its 'checkmark' property being set to a valid guid, and retrieve a reference to the
  *   entity associated with this guid whenever it changes (i.e. via `app.root.findByGuid()`).
  * - Once a valid entity is received, check to see whether it has already has an
  *   ImageElementComponent or not:
  *   - If it has one, proceed to set the tint of the ImageElementComponent based on whether the
  *     Checkbox is currently active or inactive.
  *   - If it doesn't have one, add a listener to wait for the addition of an ImageElementComponent,
  *     and then apply the tint once one becomes present.
  * - If the checkmark entity is then reassigned (such as if the user reassigns the field in the
  *   editor, or if this is done at runtime via a script), a well-behaved Checkbox component must
  *   also undo the tinting so that no lasting effect is applied to the old entity.
  * - If the checkmark entity's ImageElementComponent is removed and then another
  *   ImageElementComponent is added, the Checkbox component must handle this in order to re-apply
  *   the tint.
  * - To prevent memory leaks, the Checkbox component must also make sure to correctly remove
  *   listeners in each of the following scenarios:
  *   - Destruction of the Checkbox component.
  *   - Reassignment of the checkmark entity.
  *   - Removal of the ImageElementComponent.
  * - It must also be careful not to double-add listeners in any of the above code paths, to avoid
  *   various forms of undesirable behavior.
  *
  * If the Checkbox component becomes more complicated and has multiple entity reference properties,
  * all of the above must be done correctly for each entity. Similarly, if it depends on multiple
  * different component types being present on the entities it has references to, it must correctly
  * handle the presence and non-presence of each of these components in the various possible
  * sequences of addition and removal. In addition to generating a lot of boilerplate, it's also
  * very easy for subtle mistakes to be made that lead to memory leaks, null reference errors or
  * visual bugs.
  *
  * By using an EntityReference, all of the above can be reduced to the following:
  *
  * ```javascript
  * function CheckboxComponent() {
  *    this._checkmarkReference = new pc.EntityReference(this, 'checkmark', {
  *        'element#gain': this._onCheckmarkImageElementGain,
  *        'element#lose': this._onCheckmarkImageElementLose
  *    });
  * }
  * ```
  *
  * Using the above code snippet, the `_onCheckmarkImageElementGain()` listener will be called
  * in either of the following scenarios:
  *
  * 1. A checkmark entity is assigned and already has an ElementComponent.
  * 2. A checkmark entity is assigned that does not have an ElementComponent, but one is added
  * later.
  *
  * Similarly, the `_onCheckmarkImageElementLose()` listener will be called in either of the
  * following scenarios:
  *
  * 1. An ElementComponent is removed from the checkmark entity.
  * 2. The checkmark entity is re-assigned (i.e. to another entity), or nullified. In this
  * scenario the callback will only be called if the entity actually had an ElementComponent.
  *
  * ## Event String Format ##
  *
  * The event string (i.e. "element#gain" in the above examples) is of the format
  * `sourceName#eventName`, and is defined as follows:
  *
  * - `sourceName`: May be any component name, or the special string "entity", which refers to the
  * entity itself.
  * - `eventName`: May be the name of any event dispatched by the relevant component or entity, as
  * well as the special strings "gain" or "lose".
  *
  * Some examples are as follows:
  *
  * ```javascript
  * "entity#destroy"    // Called when the entity managed by the entity reference is destroyed.
  * "element#set:width" // Called when the width of an ElementComponent is set.
  * ```
  *
  * When the entity reference changes to another entity (or null) the set:entity event is fired.
  *
  * ## Ownership and Destruction ##
  *
  * The lifetime of an ElementReference is tied to the parent component that instantiated it. This
  * coupling is indicated by the provision of the `this` keyword to the ElementReference's
  * constructor in the above examples (i.e. `new pc.EntityReference(this, ...`).
  *
  * Any event listeners managed by the ElementReference are automatically cleaned up when the parent
  * component is removed or the parent component's entity is destroyed – as such you should never
  * have to worry about dangling listeners.
  *
  * Additionally, any callbacks listed in the event config will automatically be called in the scope
  * of the parent component – you should never have to worry about manually calling
  * `Function.bind()`.
