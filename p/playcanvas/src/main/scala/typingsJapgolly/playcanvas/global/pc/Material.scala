/**
  * A material determines how a particular mesh instance is rendered. It specifies the shader and
  * render state that is set before the mesh instance is submitted to the graphics device.
  *
  * @property {number} alphaTest The alpha test reference value to control which fragments are
  * written to the currently active render target based on alpha value. All fragments with an alpha
  * value of less than the alphaTest reference value will be discarded. alphaTest defaults to 0 (all
  * fragments pass).
  * @property {boolean} alphaToCoverage Enables or disables alpha to coverage (WebGL2 only). When
  * enabled, and if hardware anti-aliasing is on, limited order-independent transparency can be
  * achieved. Quality depends on the number of MSAA samples of the current render target.
  * It can nicely soften edges of otherwise sharp alpha cutouts, but isn't recommended for large
  * area semi-transparent surfaces. Note, that you don't need to enable blending to make alpha to
  * coverage work. It will work without it, just like alphaTest.
  * @property {boolean} alphaWrite If true, the alpha component of fragments generated by the shader
  * of this material is written to the color buffer of the currently active render target. If false,
  * the alpha component will not be written. Defaults to true.
  * @property {number} blendType Controls how primitives are blended when being written to the
  * currently active render target. Can be:
  *
  * - {@link BLEND_SUBTRACTIVE}: Subtract the color of the source fragment from the destination
  * fragment and write the result to the frame buffer.
  * - {@link BLEND_ADDITIVE}: Add the color of the source fragment to the destination fragment and
  * write the result to the frame buffer.
  * - {@link BLEND_NORMAL}: Enable simple translucency for materials such as glass. This is
  * equivalent to enabling a source blend mode of {@link BLENDMODE_SRC_ALPHA} and a destination
  * blend mode of {@link BLENDMODE_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA}.
  * - {@link BLEND_NONE}: Disable blending.
  * - {@link BLEND_PREMULTIPLIED}: Similar to {@link BLEND_NORMAL} expect the source fragment is
  * assumed to have already been multiplied by the source alpha value.
  * - {@link BLEND_MULTIPLICATIVE}: Multiply the color of the source fragment by the color of the
  * destination fragment and write the result to the frame buffer.
  * - {@link BLEND_ADDITIVEALPHA}: Same as {@link BLEND_ADDITIVE} except the source RGB is
  * multiplied by the source alpha.
  * - {@link BLEND_MULTIPLICATIVE2X}: Multiplies colors and doubles the result.
  * - {@link BLEND_SCREEN}: Softer version of additive.
  * - {@link BLEND_MIN}: Minimum color. Check app.graphicsDevice.extBlendMinmax for support.
  * - {@link BLEND_MAX}: Maximum color. Check app.graphicsDevice.extBlendMinmax for support.
  *
  * Defaults to {@link BLEND_NONE}.
  * @property {boolean} blueWrite If true, the blue component of fragments generated by the shader
  * of this material is written to the color buffer of the currently active render target. If false,
  * the blue component will not be written. Defaults to true.
  * @property {number} cull Controls how triangles are culled based on their face direction with
  * respect to the viewpoint. Can be:
  *
  * - {@link CULLFACE_NONE}: Do not cull triangles based on face direction.
  * - {@link CULLFACE_BACK}: Cull the back faces of triangles (do not render triangles facing away
  * from the view point).
  * - {@link CULLFACE_FRONT}: Cull the front faces of triangles (do not render triangles facing
  * towards the view point).
  * - {@link CULLFACE_FRONTANDBACK}: Cull both front and back faces (triangles will not be
  * rendered).
  *
  * Defaults to {@link CULLFACE_BACK}.
  * @property {boolean} depthTest If true, fragments generated by the shader of this material are
  * only written to the current render target if they pass the depth test. If false, fragments
  * generated by the shader of this material are written to the current render target regardless of
  * what is in the depth buffer. Defaults to true.
  * @property {number} depthFunc Controls how the depth of new fragments is compared against the
  * current depth contained in the depth buffer. Can be:
  *
  * - {@link FUNC_NEVER}: don't draw
  * - {@link FUNC_LESS}: draw if new depth < depth buffer
  * - {@link FUNC_EQUAL}: draw if new depth == depth buffer
  * - {@link FUNC_LESSEQUAL}: draw if new depth <= depth buffer
  * - {@link FUNC_GREATER}: draw if new depth > depth buffer
  * - {@link FUNC_NOTEQUAL}: draw if new depth != depth buffer
  * - {@link FUNC_GREATEREQUAL}: draw if new depth >= depth buffer
  * - {@link FUNC_ALWAYS}: always draw
  *
  * Defaults to {@link FUNC_LESSEQUAL}.
  * @property {boolean} depthWrite If true, fragments generated by the shader of this material write
  * a depth value to the depth buffer of the currently active render target. If false, no depth
  * value is written. Defaults to true.
  * @property {boolean} greenWrite If true, the green component of fragments generated by the shader
  * of this material is written to the color buffer of the currently active render target. If false,
  * the green component will not be written. Defaults to true.
  * @property {string} name The name of the material.
  * @property {boolean} redWrite If true, the red component of fragments generated by the shader of
  * this material is written to the color buffer of the currently active render target. If false,
  * the red component will not be written. Defaults to true.
  * @property {Shader|null} shader The shader used by this material to render mesh instances
  * (default is null).
  * @property {StencilParameters|null} stencilFront Stencil parameters for front faces (default is
  * null).
  * @property {StencilParameters|null} stencilBack Stencil parameters for back faces (default is
  * null).
  * @property {number} depthBias Offsets the output depth buffer value. Useful for decals to prevent
  * z-fighting.
  * @property {number} slopeDepthBias Same as {@link Material#depthBias}, but also depends on the
  * slope of the triangle relative to the camera.
