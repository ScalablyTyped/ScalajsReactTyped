    * @param {object} [options] - Options passed when creating the WebGL context.
    * @param {boolean} [options.alpha=true] - Boolean that indicates if the canvas contains an
    * alpha buffer.
    * @param {boolean} [options.depth=true] - Boolean that indicates that the drawing buffer is
    * requested to have a depth buffer of at least 16 bits.
    * @param {boolean} [options.stencil=false] - Boolean that indicates that the drawing buffer is
    * requested to have a stencil buffer of at least 8 bits.
    * @param {boolean} [options.antialias=true] - Boolean that indicates whether or not to perform
    * anti-aliasing if possible.
    * @param {boolean} [options.premultipliedAlpha=true] - Boolean that indicates that the page
    * compositor will assume the drawing buffer contains colors with pre-multiplied alpha.
    * @param {boolean} [options.preserveDrawingBuffer=false] - If the value is true the buffers
    * will not be cleared and will preserve their values until cleared or overwritten by the
    * author.
    * @param {'default'|'high-performance'|'low-power'} [options.powerPreference='default'] - A
    * hint to the user agent indicating what configuration of GPU is suitable for the WebGL
    * context. Possible values are:
    *
    * - 'default': Let the user agent decide which GPU configuration is most suitable. This is the
    * default value.
    * - 'high-performance': Prioritizes rendering performance over power consumption.
    * - 'low-power': Prioritizes power saving over rendering performance.
    *
    * @param {boolean} [options.failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat=false] - Boolean that indicates if a
    * context will be created if the system performance is low or if no hardware GPU is available.
    * @param {boolean} [options.preferWebGl2=true] - Boolean that indicates if a WebGl2 context
    * should be preferred.
    * @param {boolean} [options.desynchronized=false] - Boolean that hints the user agent to
    * reduce the latency by desynchronizing the canvas paint cycle from the event loop.
    * @param {boolean} [options.xrCompatible] - Boolean that hints to the user agent to use a
    * compatible graphics adapter for an immersive XR device.
