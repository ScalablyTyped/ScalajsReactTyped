/**
  * @class
  * @name pc.StandardMaterial
  * @augments pc.Material
  * @classdesc A Standard material is the main, general purpose material that is most often used for rendering.
  * It can approximate a wide variety of surface types and can simulate dynamic reflected light.
  * Most maps can use 3 types of input values in any combination: constant (color or number), mesh vertex colors and a texture. All enabled inputs are multiplied together.
  *
  * @property {pc.Color} ambient The ambient color of the material. This color value is 3-component (RGB),
  * where each component is between 0 and 1.
  *
  * @property {pc.Color} diffuse The diffuse color of the material. This color value is 3-component (RGB),
  * where each component is between 0 and 1.
  * Defines basic surface color (aka albedo).
  * @property {boolean} diffuseTint Multiply diffuse map and/or diffuse vertex color by the constant diffuse value.
  * @property {pc.Texture|null} diffuseMap The diffuse map of the material (default is null).
  * @property {number} diffuseMapUv Diffuse map UV channel.
  * @property {pc.Vec2} diffuseMapTiling Controls the 2D tiling of the diffuse map.
  * @property {pc.Vec2} diffuseMapOffset Controls the 2D offset of the diffuse map. Each component is between 0 and 1.
  * @property {string} diffuseMapChannel Color channels of the diffuse map to use. Can be "r", "g", "b", "a", "rgb" or any swizzled combination.
  * @property {boolean} diffuseVertexColor Use mesh vertex colors for diffuse. If diffuseMap or are diffuseTint are set, they'll be multiplied by vertex colors.
  * @property {string} diffuseVertexColorChannel Vertex color channels to use for diffuse. Can be "r", "g", "b", "a", "rgb" or any swizzled combination.
  *
  * @property {pc.Color} specular The specular color of the material. This color value is 3-component (RGB),
  * where each component is between 0 and 1.
  * Defines surface reflection/specular color. Affects specular intensity and tint.
  * @property {boolean} specularTint Multiply specular map and/or specular vertex color by the constant specular value.
  * @property {pc.Texture|null} specularMap The specular map of the material (default is null).
  * @property {number} specularMapUv Specular map UV channel.
  * @property {pc.Vec2} specularMapTiling Controls the 2D tiling of the specular map.
  * @property {pc.Vec2} specularMapOffset Controls the 2D offset of the specular map. Each component is between 0 and 1.
  * @property {string} specularMapChannel Color channels of the specular map to use. Can be "r", "g", "b", "a", "rgb" or any swizzled combination.
  * @property {boolean} specularVertexColor Use mesh vertex colors for specular. If specularMap or are specularTint are set, they'll be multiplied by vertex colors.
  * @property {string} specularVertexColorChannel Vertex color channels to use for specular. Can be "r", "g", "b", "a", "rgb" or any swizzled combination.
  *
  * @property {boolean} useMetalness Use metalness properties instead of specular.
  * When enabled, diffuse colors also affect specular instead of the dedicated specular map.
  * This can be used as alternative to specular color to save space.
  * With metaless == 0, the pixel is assumed to be dielectric, and diffuse color is used as normal.
  * With metaless == 1, the pixel is fully metallic, and diffuse color is used as specular color instead.
  * @property {number} metalness Defines how much the surface is metallic. From 0 (dielectric) to 1 (metal).
  * @property {pc.Texture|null} metalnessMap Monochrome metalness map (default is null).
  * @property {number} metalnessMapUv Metalness map UV channel.
  * @property {pc.Vec2} metalnessMapTiling Controls the 2D tiling of the metalness map.
  * @property {pc.Vec2} metalnessMapOffset Controls the 2D offset of the metalness map. Each component is between 0 and 1.

  *
  * @property {number} shininess Defines glossiness of the material from 0 (rough) to 100 (shiny mirror).
  * A higher shininess value results in a more focused specular highlight.
  * Glossiness map/vertex colors are always multiplied by this value (normalized to 0 - 1 range), or it is used directly as constant output.
  * @property {pc.Texture|null} glossMap Glossiness map (default is null). If specified, will be multiplied by normalized 'shininess' value and/or vertex colors.
  * @property {number} glossMapUv Gloss map UV channel.
  * @property {string} glossMapChannel Color channel of the gloss map to use. Can be "r", "g", "b" or "a".

  * The value is calculated as (outerIor / surfaceIor), where inputs are measured indices of refraction, the one around the object and the one of it's own surface.
  * In most situations outer medium is air, so outerIor will be approximately 1. Then you only need to do (1.0 / surfaceIor).
  *

  * where each component is between 0 and 1.
  * @property {boolean} emissiveTint Multiply emissive map and/or emissive vertex color by the constant emissive value.
  * @property {pc.Texture|null} emissiveMap The emissive map of the material (default is null). Can be HDR.

  *
  * @property {number} opacity The opacity of the material. This value can be between 0 and 1, where 0 is fully
  * transparent and 1 is fully opaque. If you want the material to be semi-transparent you also need to
  * set the {@link pc.Material#blendType} to pc.BLEND_NORMAL, pc.BLEND_ADDITIVE or any other mode.
  * Also note that for most semi-transparent objects you want {@link pc.Material#depthWrite} to be false, otherwise they can fully occlude objects behind them.
  * @property {pc.Texture|null} opacityMap The opacity map of the material (default is null).
  * @property {number} opacityMapUv Opacity map UV channel.
  * @property {string} opacityMapChannel Color channel of the opacity map to use. Can be "r", "g", "b" or "a".

  *
  * @property {pc.Texture|null} heightMap The height map of the material (default is null). Used for a view-dependent parallax effect.

  * * {@link pc.CUBEPROJ_NONE}: The cube map is treated as if it is infinitely far away.

  * Defaults to pc.CUBEPROJ_NONE.

  * @property {object} chunks Object containing custom shader chunks that will replace default ones.
  *
  * @property {pc.callbacks.UpdateShader} onUpdateShader A custom function that will be called after all shader generator properties are collected and before shader code is generated.

  * Returned value will be used instead. This is mostly useful when rendering the same set of objects, but with different shader variations based on the same material.
  * For example, you may wish to render a depth or normal pass using textures assigned to the material, a reflection pass with simpler shaders and so on.

  * @example

  * var material = new pc.StandardMaterial();
  *
  * // Update the material's diffuse and specular properties
  * material.diffuse.set(1, 0, 0);
  * material.specular.set(1, 1, 1);
