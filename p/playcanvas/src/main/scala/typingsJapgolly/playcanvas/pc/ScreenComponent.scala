  * @class
  * @name pc.ScreenComponent
  * @augments pc.Component
  * @classdesc A ScreenComponent enables the Entity to render child {@link pc.ElementComponent}s using anchors and positions in the ScreenComponent's space.
  * @description Create a new ScreenComponent.
  * @param {pc.ScreenComponentSystem} system - The ComponentSystem that created this Component.
  * @param {pc.Entity} entity - The Entity that this Component is attached to.
  * @property {boolean} screenSpace If true then the ScreenComponent will render its child {@link pc.ElementComponent}s in screen space instead of world space. Enable this to create 2D user interfaces.
  * @property {boolean} cull If true then elements inside this screen will be not be rendered when outside of the screen (only valid when screenSpace is true).
  * @property {string} scaleMode Can either be {@link pc.SCALEMODE_NONE} or {@link pc.SCALEMODE_BLEND}. See the description of referenceResolution for more information.
  * @property {number} scaleBlend A value between 0 and 1 that is used when scaleMode is equal to {@link pc.SCALEMODE_BLEND}. Scales the ScreenComponent with width as a reference (when value is 0), the height as a reference (when value is 1) or anything in between.
  * @property {pc.Vec2} resolution The width and height of the ScreenComponent. When screenSpace is true the resolution will always be equal to {@link pc.GraphicsDevice#width} x {@link pc.GraphicsDevice#height}.
  * @property {pc.Vec2} referenceResolution The resolution that the ScreenComponent is designed for. This is only taken into account when screenSpace is true and scaleMode is {@link pc.SCALEMODE_BLEND}. If the actual resolution is different then the ScreenComponent will be scaled according to the scaleBlend value.
