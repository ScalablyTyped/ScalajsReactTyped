/**
  * @class
  * @name pc.Asset
  * @augments pc.EventHandler
  * @classdesc An asset record of a file or data resource that can be loaded by the engine.
  * The asset contains three important fields:
  *
  * * `file`: contains the details of a file (filename, url) which contains the resource data, e.g. an image file for a texture asset.
  * * `data`: contains a JSON blob which contains either the resource data for the asset (e.g. material data) or additional data for the file (e.g. material mappings for a model).
  * * `resource`: contains the final resource when it is loaded. (e.g. a {@link pc.StandardMaterial} or a {@link pc.Texture}).
  *
  * See the {@link pc.AssetRegistry} for details on loading resources from assets.
  * @description Create a new Asset record. Generally, Assets are created in the loading process and you won't need to create them by hand.
  * @param {string} name - A non-unique but human-readable name which can be later used to retrieve the asset.
  * @param {string} type - Type of asset. One of ["animation", "audio", "binary", "cubemap", "css", "font", "json", "html", "material", "model", "script", "shader", "text", "texture"]
  * @param {object} [file] - Details about the file the asset is made from. At the least must contain the 'url' field. For assets that don't contain file data use null.
  * @example
  * var file = {
  *     filename: "filename.txt",
  *     url: "/example/filename.txt"
  * };
  * @param {object} [data] - JSON object with additional data about the asset (e.g. for texture and model assets) or contains the asset data itself (e.g. in the case of materials)
  * @example
  * var asset = new pc.Asset("a texture", "texture", {
  *     url: "http://example.com/my/assets/here/texture.png"
  * });
  * @property {string} name The name of the asset
  * @property {number} id The asset id
  * @property {string} type The type of the asset. One of ["animation", "audio", "binary", "cubemap", "css", "font", "json", "html", "material", "model", "script", "shader", "text", "texture"]
  * @property {pc.Tags} tags Interface for tagging. Allows to find assets by tags using {@link pc.AssetRegistry#findByTag} method.
  * @property {object} file The file details or null if no file
  * @property {string} [file.url] The URL of the resource file that contains the asset data
  * @property {string} [file.filename] The filename of the resource file
  * @property {number} [file.size] The size of the resource file
  * @property {string} [file.hash] The MD5 hash of the resource file data and the Asset data field
  * @property {object} data JSON data that contains either the complete resource data (e.g. in the case of a material) or additional data (e.g. in the case of a model it contains mappings from mesh to material)
  * @property {object} resource A reference to the resource when the asset is loaded. e.g. a {@link pc.Texture} or a {@link pc.Model}
  * @property {Array} resources A reference to the resources of the asset when it's loaded. An asset can hold more runtime resources than one e.g. cubemaps
  * @property {boolean} preload If true the asset will be loaded during the preload phase of application set up.
  * @property {boolean} loaded True if the resource is loaded. e.g. if asset.resource is not null
  * @property {boolean} loading True if the resource is currently being loaded
  * @property {pc.AssetRegistry} registry The asset registry that this Asset belongs to
