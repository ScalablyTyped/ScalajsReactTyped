  * @class
  * @name pc.BatchGroup
  * @classdesc Holds mesh batching settings and a unique id. Created via {@link pc.BatchManager#addGroup}.
  * @param {number} id - Unique id. Can be assigned to model and element components.
  * @param {string} name - The name of the group.
  * @param {boolean} dynamic - Whether objects within this batch group should support transforming at runtime.
  * @param {number} maxAabbSize - Maximum size of any dimension of a bounding box around batched objects.
  * {@link pc.BatchManager#prepare} will split objects into local groups based on this size.
  * @param {number[]} [layers] - Layer ID array. Default is [pc.LAYERID_WORLD]. The whole batch group will belong
  * to these layers. Layers of source models will be ignored.
  * @property {boolean} dynamic Whether objects within this batch group should support transforming at runtime.
  * @property {number} maxAabbSize Maximum size of any dimension of a bounding box around batched objects.
