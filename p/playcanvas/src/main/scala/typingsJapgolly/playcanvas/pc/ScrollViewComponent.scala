  * @component
  * @class
  * @name pc.ScrollViewComponent
  * @augments pc.Component
  * @classdesc A ScrollViewComponent enables a group of entities to behave like a masked scrolling area, with optional horizontal and vertical scroll bars.
  * @description Create a new ScrollViewComponent.
  * @param {pc.ScrollViewComponentSystem} system - The ComponentSystem that created this Component.
  * @param {pc.Entity} entity - The Entity that this Component is attached to.
  * @property {boolean} horizontal Whether to enable horizontal scrolling.
  * @property {boolean} vertical Whether to enable vertical scrolling.
  * @property {number} scrollMode Specifies how the scroll view should behave when the user scrolls past the end of the content. Modes are defined as follows:
  *
  * * {@link pc.SCROLL_MODE_CLAMP}: Content does not scroll any further than its bounds.
  * * {@link pc.SCROLL_MODE_BOUNCE}: Content scrolls past its bounds and then gently bounces back.
  * * {@link pc.SCROLL_MODE_INFINITE}: Content can scroll forever.
  *
  * @property {number} bounceAmount Controls how far the content should move before bouncing back.
  * @property {number} friction Controls how freely the content should move if thrown, i.e. By flicking on a phone or by flinging the scroll wheel on a mouse. A value of 1 means that content will stop immediately; 0 means that content will continue moving forever (or until the bounds of the content are reached, depending on the scrollMode).
  * @property {number} horizontalScrollbarVisibility Controls whether the horizontal scrollbar should be visible all the time, or only visible when the content exceeds the size of the viewport.
  * @property {number} verticalScrollbarVisibility Controls whether the vertical scrollbar should be visible all the time, or only visible when the content exceeds the size of the viewport.
  * @property {pc.Entity} viewportEntity The entity to be used as the masked viewport area, within which the content will scroll. This entity must have an ElementGroup component.
  * @property {pc.Entity} contentEntity The entity which contains the scrolling content itself. This entity must have an Element component.
  * @property {pc.Entity} horizontalScrollbarEntity The entity to be used as the vertical scrollbar. This entity must have a Scrollbar component.
  * @property {pc.Entity} verticalScrollbarEntity The entity to be used as the vertical scrollbar. This entity must have a Scrollbar component.
