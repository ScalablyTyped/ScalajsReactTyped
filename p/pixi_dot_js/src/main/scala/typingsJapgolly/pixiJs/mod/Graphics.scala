  * The Graphics class contains methods used to draw primitive shapes such as lines, circles and
  * rectangles to the display, and to color and fill them.
  *
  * Note that because Graphics can share a GraphicsGeometry with other instances,
  * it is necessary to call `destroy()` to properly dereference the underlying
  * GraphicsGeometry and avoid a memory leak. Alternatively, keep using the same
  * Graphics instance and call `clear()` between redraws.
