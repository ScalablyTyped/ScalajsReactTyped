  * @param maxSize - The maximum number of particles that can be rendered by the container.
  *  Affects size of allocated buffers.
  * @param properties - The properties of children that should be uploaded to the gpu and applied.
  * @param {boolean} [properties.vertices=false] - When true, vertices be uploaded and applied.
  *                  if sprite's ` scale/anchor/trim/frame/orig` is dynamic, please set `true`.
  * @param {boolean} [properties.position=true] - When true, position be uploaded and applied.
  * @param {boolean} [properties.rotation=false] - When true, rotation be uploaded and applied.
  * @param {boolean} [properties.uvs=false] - When true, uvs be uploaded and applied.
  * @param {boolean} [properties.tint=false] - When true, alpha and tint be uploaded and applied.
  * @param {number} [batchSize=16384] - Number of particles per batch. If less than maxSize, it uses maxSize instead.
  * @param {boolean} [autoResize=false] - If true, container allocates more batches in case
  *  there are more than `maxSize` particles.
