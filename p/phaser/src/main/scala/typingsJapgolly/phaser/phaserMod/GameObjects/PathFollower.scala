/**
  * A PathFollower Game Object.
  * 
  * A PathFollower is a Sprite Game Object with some extra helpers to allow it to follow a Path automatically.
  * 
  * Anything you can do with a standard Sprite can be done with this PathFollower, such as animate it, tint it,
  * scale it and so on.
  * 
  * PathFollowers are bound to a single Path at any one time and can traverse the length of the Path, from start
  * to finish, forwards or backwards, or from any given point on the Path to its end. They can optionally rotate
  * to face the direction of the path, be offset from the path coordinates or rotate independently of the Path.
