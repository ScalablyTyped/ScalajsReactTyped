/**
  * A wrapper around a Tile that provides access to a corresponding Matter body. A tile can only
  * have one Matter body associated with it. You can either pass in an existing Matter body for
  * the tile or allow the constructor to create the corresponding body for you. If the Tile has a
  * collision group (defined in Tiled), those shapes will be used to create the body. If not, the
  * tile's rectangle bounding box will be used.
  * 
  * The corresponding body will be accessible on the Tile itself via Tile.physics.matterBody.
  * 
  * Note: not all Tiled collision shapes are supported. See
  * Phaser.Physics.Matter.TileBody#setFromTileCollision for more information.
