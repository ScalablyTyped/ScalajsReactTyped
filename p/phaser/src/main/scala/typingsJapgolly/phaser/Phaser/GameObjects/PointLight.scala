/**
  * The Point Light Game Object provides a way to add a point light effect into your game,
  * without the expensive shader processing requirements of the traditional Light Game Object.
  * 
  * The difference is that the Point Light renders using a custom shader, designed to give the
  * impression of a point light source, of variable radius, intensity and color, in your game.
  * However, unlike the Light Game Object, it does not impact any other Game Objects, or use their
  * normal maps for calcuations. This makes them extremely fast to render compared to Lights
  * and perfect for special effects, such as flickering torches or muzzle flashes.
  * 
  * For maximum performance you should batch Point Light Game Objects together. This means
  * ensuring they follow each other consecutively on the display list. Ideally, use a Layer
  * Game Object and then add just Point Lights to it, so that it can batch together the rendering
  * of the lights. You don't _have_ to do this, and if you've only a handful of Point Lights in
  * your game then it's perfectly safe to mix them into the dislay list as normal. However, if
  * you're using a large number of them, please consider how they are mixed into the display list.
  * 
  * The renderer will automatically cull Point Lights. Those with a radius that does not intersect
  * with the Camera will be skipped in the rendering list. This happens automatically and the
  * culled state is refreshed every frame, for every camera.
  * 
  * The origin of a Point Light is always 0.5 and it cannot be changed.
  * 
  * Point Lights are a WebGL only feature and do not have a Canvas counterpart.
