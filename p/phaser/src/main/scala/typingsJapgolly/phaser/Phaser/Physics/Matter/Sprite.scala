/**
  * A Matter Physics Sprite Game Object.
  * 
  * A Sprite Game Object is used for the display of both static and animated images in your game.
  * Sprites can have input events and physics bodies. They can also be tweened, tinted, scrolled
  * and animated.
  * 
  * The main difference between a Sprite and an Image Game Object is that you cannot animate Images.
  * As such, Sprites take a fraction longer to process and have a larger API footprint due to the Animation
  * Component. If you do not require animation then you can safely use Images to replace Sprites in all cases.
