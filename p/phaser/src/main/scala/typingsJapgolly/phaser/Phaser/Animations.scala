      * You can find more details at https://www.aseprite.org/
      * 
      * To export a compatible JSON file in Aseprite, please do the following:
      * 
      * 1. Go to "File - Export Sprite Sheet"
      * 
      * 2. On the **Layout** tab:
      * 2a. Set the "Sheet type" to "Packed"
      * 2b. Set the "Constraints" to "None"
      * 2c. Check the "Merge Duplicates" checkbox
      * 
      * 3. On the **Sprite** tab:
      * 3a. Set "Layers" to "Visible layers"
      * 3b. Set "Frames" to "All frames", unless you only wish to export a sub-set of tags
      * 
      * 4. On the **Borders** tab:
      * 4a. Check the "Trim Sprite" and "Trim Cells" options
      * 4b. Ensure "Border Padding", "Spacing" and "Inner Padding" are all > 0 (1 is usually enough)
      * 
      * 5. On the **Output** tab:
      * 5a. Check "Output File", give your image a name and make sure you choose "png files" as the file type
      * 5b. Check "JSON Data" and give your json file a name
      * 5c. The JSON Data type can be either a Hash or Array, Phaser doesn't mind.
      * 5d. Make sure "Tags" is checked in the Meta options
      * 5e. In the "Item Filename" input box, make sure it says just "{frame}" and nothing more.
      * 
      * 6. Click export
      * 
      * This was tested with Aseprite 1.2.25.
      * 
      * This will export a png and json file which you can load using the Aseprite Loader, i.e.:
      * 
      * ```javascript
      * function preload ()
      * {
      *     this.load.path = 'assets/animations/aseprite/';
      *     this.load.aseprite('paladin', 'paladin.png', 'paladin.json');
      * }
      * ```
      * 
      * Once loaded, you can call this method from within a Scene with the 'atlas' key:
      * 
      * ```javascript
      * this.anims.createFromAseprite('paladin');
      * ```
      * 
      * Any animations defined in the JSON will now be available to use in Phaser and you play them
      * via their Tag name. For example, if you have an animation called 'War Cry' on your Aseprite timeline,
      * you can play it in Phaser using that Tag name:
      * 
      * ```javascript
      * this.add.sprite(400, 300).play('War Cry');
      * ```
      * 
      * When calling this method you can optionally provide an array of tag names, and only those animations
      * will be created. For example:
      * 
      * ```javascript
      * this.anims.createFromAseprite('paladin', [ 'step', 'War Cry', 'Magnum Break' ]);
      * ```
      * 
      * This will only create the 3 animations defined. Note that the tag names are case-sensitive.
      * @param key The key of the loaded Aseprite atlas. It must have been loaded prior to calling this method.
