/**
  * A Mesh Game Object.
  * 
  * The Mesh Game Object allows you to render a group of textured vertices and manipulate
  * the view of those vertices, such as rotation, translation or scaling.
  * 
  * Support for generating mesh data from grids, model data or Wavefront OBJ Files is included.
  * 
  * Although you can use this to render 3D objects, its primary use is for displaying more complex
  * Sprites, or Sprites where you need fine-grained control over the vertex positions in order to
  * achieve special effects in your games. Note that rendering still takes place using Phaser's
  * orthographic camera (after being transformed via `projectionMesh`, see `setPerspective`,
  * `setOrtho`, and `panZ` methods). As a result, all depth and face tests are done in an eventually
  * orthographic space.
  * 
  * The rendering process will iterate through the faces of this Mesh and render out each face
  * that is considered as being in view of the camera. No depth buffer is used, and because of this,
  * you should be careful not to use model data with too many vertices, or overlapping geometry,
  * or you'll probably encounter z-depth fighting. The Mesh was designed to allow for more advanced
  * 2D layouts, rather than displaying 3D objects, even though it can do this to a degree.
  * 
  * In short, if you want to remake Crysis, use a 3D engine, not a Mesh. However, if you want
  * to easily add some small fun 3D elements into your game, or create some special effects involving
  * vertex warping, this is the right object for you. Mesh data becomes part of the WebGL batch,
  * just like standard Sprites, so doesn't introduce any additional shader overhead. Because
  * the Mesh just generates vertices into the WebGL batch, like any other Sprite, you can use all of
  * the common Game Object components on a Mesh too, such as a custom pipeline, mask, blend mode
  * or texture.
  * 
  * Note that the Mesh object is WebGL only and does not have a Canvas counterpart.
  * 
  * The Mesh origin is always 0.5 x 0.5 and cannot be changed.

  /**
    * Adds new vertices to this Mesh by parsing the given data.
    * 
    * This method will take vertex data in one of two formats, based on the `containsZ` parameter.
    * 
    * If your vertex data are `x`, `y` pairs, then `containsZ` should be `false` (this is the default, and will result in `z=0` for each vertex).
    * 
    * If your vertex data is groups of `x`, `y` and `z` values, then the `containsZ` parameter must be true.
    * 
    * The `uvs` parameter is a numeric array consisting of `u` and `v` pairs.
    * 
    * The `normals` parameter is a numeric array consisting of `x`, `y` vertex normal values and, if `containsZ` is true, `z` values as well.
    * 
    * The `indicies` parameter is an optional array that, if given, is an indexed list of vertices to be added.
    * 
    * The `colors` parameter is an optional array, or single value, that if given sets the color of each vertex created.
    * 
    * The `alphas` parameter is an optional array, or single value, that if given sets the alpha of each vertex created.
    * 
    * When providing indexed data it is assumed that _all_ of the arrays are indexed, not just the vertices.
    * 
    * The following example will create a 256 x 256 sized quad using an index array:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * let mesh = new Mesh(this);  // Assuming `this` is a scene!
    * const vertices = [
    *   -128, 128,
    *   128, 128,
    *   -128, -128,
    *   128, -128
    * ];
    * 
    * const uvs = [
    *   0, 1,
    *   1, 1,
    *   0, 0,
    *   1, 0
    * ];
    * 
    * const indices = [ 0, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1 ];
    * 
    * mesh.addVertices(vertices, uvs, indicies);
    * // Note: Otherwise the added points will be "behind" the camera! This value will project vertex `x` & `y` values 1:1 to pixel values.
    * mesh.hideCCW = false;
    * mesh.setOrtho(mesh.width, mesh.height);
    * ```
    * 
    * If the data is not indexed, it's assumed that the arrays all contain sequential data.
    * @param vertices The vertices array. Either `xy` pairs, or `xyz` if the `containsZ` parameter is `true`.
    * @param uvs The UVs pairs array.
    * @param indicies Optional vertex indicies array. If you don't have one, pass `null` or an empty array.
    * @param containsZ Does the vertices data include a `z` component? If not, it will be assumed `z=0`, see methods `panZ` or `setOrtho`. Default false.
    * @param normals Optional vertex normals array. If you don't have one, pass `null` or an empty array.
    * @param colors An array of colors, one per vertex, or a single color value applied to all vertices. Default 0xffffff.
    * @param alphas An array of alpha values, one per vertex, or a single alpha value applied to all vertices. Default 1.
