/**
  * A Sprite Game Object.
  * 
  * A Sprite Game Object is used for the display of both static and animated images in your game.
  * Sprites can have input events and physics bodies. They can also be tweened, tinted, scrolled
  * and animated.
  * 
  * The main difference between a Sprite and an Image Game Object is that you cannot animate Images.
  * As such, Sprites take a fraction longer to process and have a larger API footprint due to the Animation
  * Component. If you do not require animation then you can safely use Images to replace Sprites in all cases.

  /**
    * Start playing the given animation on this Sprite.
    * 
    * Animations in Phaser can either belong to the global Animation Manager, or specifically to this Sprite.
    * 
    * The benefit of a global animation is that multiple Sprites can all play the same animation, without
    * having to duplicate the data. You can just create it once and then play it on any Sprite.
    * 
    * The following code shows how to create a global repeating animation. The animation will be created
    * from all of the frames within the sprite sheet that was loaded with the key 'muybridge':
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * var config = {
    *     key: 'run',
    *     frames: 'muybridge',
    *     frameRate: 15,
    *     repeat: -1
    * };
    * 
    * //  This code should be run from within a Scene:
    * this.anims.create(config);
    * ```
    * 
    * However, if you wish to create an animation that is unique to this Sprite, and this Sprite alone,
    * you can call the `Animation.create` method instead. It accepts the exact same parameters as when
    * creating a global animation, however the resulting data is kept locally in this Sprite.
    * 
    * With the animation created, either globally or locally, you can now play it on this Sprite:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.add.sprite(x, y).play('run');
    * ```
    * 
    * Alternatively, if you wish to run it at a different frame rate, for example, you can pass a config
    * object instead:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.add.sprite(x, y).play({ key: 'run', frameRate: 24 });
    * ```
    * 
    * When playing an animation on a Sprite it will first check to see if it can find a matching key
    * locally within the Sprite. If it can, it will play the local animation. If not, it will then
    * search the global Animation Manager and look for it there.
    * 
    * If you need a Sprite to be able to play both local and global animations, make sure they don't
    * have conflicting keys.
    * 
    * See the documentation for the `PlayAnimationConfig` config object for more details about this.
    * 
    * Also, see the documentation in the Animation Manager for further details on creating animations.
