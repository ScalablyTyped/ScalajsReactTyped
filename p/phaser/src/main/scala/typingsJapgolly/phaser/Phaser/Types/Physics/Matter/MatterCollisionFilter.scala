/**
  * An `Object` that specifies the collision filtering properties of this body.
  * 
  * Collisions between two bodies will obey the following rules:
  * - If the two bodies have the same non-zero value of `collisionFilter.group`,
  *   they will always collide if the value is positive, and they will never collide
  *   if the value is negative.
  * - If the two bodies have different values of `collisionFilter.group` or if one
  *   (or both) of the bodies has a value of 0, then the category/mask rules apply as follows:
  * 
  * Each body belongs to a collision category, given by `collisionFilter.category`. This
  * value is used as a bit field and the category should have only one bit set, meaning that
  * the value of this property is a power of two in the range [1, 2^31]. Thus, there are 32
  * different collision categories available.
  * 
  * Each body also defines a collision bitmask, given by `collisionFilter.mask` which specifies
  * the categories it collides with (the value is the bitwise AND value of all these categories).
  * 
  * Using the category/mask rules, two bodies `A` and `B` collide if each includes the other's
  * category in its mask, i.e. `(categoryA & maskB) !== 0` and `(categoryB & maskA) !== 0`
  * are both true.
