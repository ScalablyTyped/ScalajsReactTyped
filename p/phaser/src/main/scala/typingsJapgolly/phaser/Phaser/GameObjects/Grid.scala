/**
  * The Grid Shape is a Game Object that can be added to a Scene, Group or Container. You can
  * treat it like any other Game Object in your game, such as tweening it, scaling it, or enabling
  * it for input or physics. It provides a quick and easy way for you to render this shape in your
  * game without using a texture, while still taking advantage of being fully batched in WebGL.
  * 
  * This shape supports only fill colors and cannot be stroked.
  * 
  * A Grid Shape allows you to display a grid in your game, where you can control the size of the
  * grid as well as the width and height of the grid cells. You can set a fill color for each grid
  * cell as well as an alternate fill color. When the alternate fill color is set then the grid
  * cells will alternate the fill colors as they render, creating a chess-board effect. You can
  * also optionally have an outline fill color. If set, this draws lines between the grid cells
  * in the given color. If you specify an outline color with an alpha of zero, then it will draw
  * the cells spaced out, but without the lines between them.
