/**
  * A Layer Game Object.
  * 
  * A Layer is a special type of Game Object that acts as a Display List. You can add any type of Game Object
  * to a Layer, just as you would to a Scene. Layers can be used to visually group together 'layers' of Game
  * Objects:
  * 
  * ```javascript
  * const spaceman = this.add.sprite(150, 300, 'spaceman');
  * const bunny = this.add.sprite(400, 300, 'bunny');
  * const elephant = this.add.sprite(650, 300, 'elephant');
  * 
  * const layer = this.add.layer();
  * 
  * layer.add([ spaceman, bunny, elephant ]);
  * ```
  * 
  * The 3 sprites in the example above will now be managed by the Layer they were added to. Therefore,
  * if you then set `layer.setVisible(false)` they would all vanish from the display.
  * 
  * You can also control the depth of the Game Objects within the Layer. For example, calling the
  * `setDepth` method of a child of a Layer will allow you to adjust the depth of that child _within the
  * Layer itself_, rather than the whole Scene. The Layer, too, can have its depth set as well.
  * 
  * The Layer class also offers many different methods for manipulating the list, such as the
  * methods `moveUp`, `moveDown`, `sendToBack`, `bringToTop` and so on. These allow you to change the
  * display list position of the Layers children, causing it to adjust the order in which they are
  * rendered. Using `setDepth` on a child allows you to override this.
  * 
  * Layers can have Post FX Pipelines set, which allows you to easily enable a post pipeline across
  * a whole range of children, which, depending on the effect, can often be far more efficient that doing so
  * on a per-child basis.
  * 
  * Layers have no position or size within the Scene. This means you cannot enable a Layer for
  * physics or input, or change the position, rotation or scale of a Layer. They also have no scroll
  * factor, texture, tint, origin, crop or bounds.
  * 
  * If you need those kind of features then you should use a Container instead. Containers can be added
  * to Layers, but Layers cannot be added to Containers.
  * 
  * However, you can set the Alpha, Blend Mode, Depth, Mask and Visible state of a Layer. These settings
  * will impact all children being rendered by the Layer.
