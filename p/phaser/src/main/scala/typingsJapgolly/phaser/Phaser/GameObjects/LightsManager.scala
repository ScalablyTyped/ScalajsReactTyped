  /**
    * Creates a new Point Light Game Object and adds it to the Scene.
    * 
    * Note: This method will only be available if the Point Light Game Object has been built into Phaser.
    * 
    * The Point Light Game Object provides a way to add a point light effect into your game,
    * without the expensive shader processing requirements of the traditional Light Game Object.
    * 
    * The difference is that the Point Light renders using a custom shader, designed to give the
    * impression of a point light source, of variable radius, intensity and color, in your game.
    * However, unlike the Light Game Object, it does not impact any other Game Objects, or use their
    * normal maps for calcuations. This makes them extremely fast to render compared to Lights
    * and perfect for special effects, such as flickering torches or muzzle flashes.
    * 
    * For maximum performance you should batch Point Light Game Objects together. This means
    * ensuring they follow each other consecutively on the display list. Ideally, use a Layer
    * Game Object and then add just Point Lights to it, so that it can batch together the rendering
    * of the lights. You don't _have_ to do this, and if you've only a handful of Point Lights in
    * your game then it's perfectly safe to mix them into the dislay list as normal. However, if
    * you're using a large number of them, please consider how they are mixed into the display list.
    * 
    * The renderer will automatically cull Point Lights. Those with a radius that does not intersect
    * with the Camera will be skipped in the rendering list. This happens automatically and the
    * culled state is refreshed every frame, for every camera.
    * 
    * The origin of a Point Light is always 0.5 and it cannot be changed.
    * 
    * Point Lights are a WebGL only feature and do not have a Canvas counterpart.
    * @param x The horizontal position of this Point Light in the world.
    * @param y The vertical position of this Point Light in the world.
    * @param color The color of the Point Light, given as a hex value. Default 0xffffff.
    * @param radius The radius of the Point Light. Default 128.
    * @param intensity The intensity, or colr blend, of the Point Light. Default 1.
    * @param attenuation The attenuation  of the Point Light. This is the reduction of light from the center point. Default 0.1.
