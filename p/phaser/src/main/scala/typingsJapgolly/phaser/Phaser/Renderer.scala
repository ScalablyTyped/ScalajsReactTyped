        * The Post FX Pipeline is a special kind of pipeline specifically for handling post
        * processing effects. Where-as a standard Pipeline allows you to control the process
        * of rendering Game Objects by configuring the shaders and attributes used to draw them,
        * a Post FX Pipeline is designed to allow you to apply processing _after_ the Game Object/s
        * have been rendered. Typical examples of post processing effects are bloom filters,
        * blurs, light effects and color manipulation.
        * 
        * The pipeline works by creating a tiny vertex buffer with just one single hard-coded quad
        * in it. Game Objects can have a Post Pipeline set on them. Those objects are then rendered
        * using their standard pipeline, but are redirected to the Render Targets owned by the
        * post pipeline, which can then apply their own shaders and effects, before passing them
        * back to the main renderer.
        * 
        * Please see the Phaser 3 examples for further details on this extensive subject.
        * 
        * The default fragment shader it uses can be found in `shaders/src/PostFX.frag`.
        * The default vertex shader it uses can be found in `shaders/src/Quad.vert`.

        * `inTexCoord` (vec2, offset 8)
