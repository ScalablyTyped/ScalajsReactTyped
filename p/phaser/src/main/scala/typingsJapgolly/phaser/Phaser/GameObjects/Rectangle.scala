  * The Rectangle Shape is a Game Object that can be added to a Scene, Group or Container. You can
  * treat it like any other Game Object in your game, such as tweening it, scaling it, or enabling
  * it for input or physics. It provides a quick and easy way for you to render this shape in your
  * game without using a texture, while still taking advantage of being fully batched in WebGL.
  * 
  * This shape supports both fill and stroke colors.
  * 
  * You can change the size of the rectangle by changing the `width` and `height` properties.

    * `setDisplaySize` method, which is the same thing as changing the scale but allows you
    * to do so by giving pixel values.

    * If you have enabled this Game Object for input, changing the size will _not_ change the
    * size of the hit area. To do this you should adjust the `input.hitArea` object directly.

    * @param height The height of this Game Object.
