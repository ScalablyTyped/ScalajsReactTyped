/**
  * A Pointer Constraint is a special type of constraint that allows you to click
  * and drag bodies in a Matter World. It monitors the active Pointers in a Scene,
  * and when one is pressed down it checks to see if that hit any part of any active
  * body in the world. If it did, and the body has input enabled, it will begin to
  * drag it until either released, or you stop it via the `stopDrag` method.
  * 
  * You can adjust the stiffness, length and other properties of the constraint via
  * the `options` object on creation.
