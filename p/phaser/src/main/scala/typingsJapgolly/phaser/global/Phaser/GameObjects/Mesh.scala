/**
  * A Mesh Game Object.
  * 
  * The Mesh Game Object allows you to render a group of textured vertices and manipulate
  * the view of those vertices, such as rotation, translation or scaling.
  * 
  * Support for generating mesh data from grids, model data or Wavefront OBJ Files is included.
  * 
  * Although you can use this to render 3D objects, its primary use is for displaying more complex
  * Sprites, or Sprites where you need fine-grained control over the vertex positions in order to
  * achieve special effects in your games. Note that rendering still takes place using Phaser's
  * orthographic camera (after being transformed via `projectionMesh`, see `setPerspective`,
  * `setOrtho`, and `panZ` methods). As a result, all depth and face tests are done in an eventually
  * orthographic space.
  * 
  * The rendering process will iterate through the faces of this Mesh and render out each face
  * that is considered as being in view of the camera. No depth buffer is used, and because of this,
  * you should be careful not to use model data with too many vertices, or overlapping geometry,
  * or you'll probably encounter z-depth fighting. The Mesh was designed to allow for more advanced
  * 2D layouts, rather than displaying 3D objects, even though it can do this to a degree.
  * 
  * In short, if you want to remake Crysis, use a 3D engine, not a Mesh. However, if you want
  * to easily add some small fun 3D elements into your game, or create some special effects involving
  * vertex warping, this is the right object for you. Mesh data becomes part of the WebGL batch,
  * just like standard Sprites, so doesn't introduce any additional shader overhead. Because
  * the Mesh just generates vertices into the WebGL batch, like any other Sprite, you can use all of
  * the common Game Object components on a Mesh too, such as a custom pipeline, mask, blend mode
  * or texture.
  * 
  * Note that the Mesh object is WebGL only and does not have a Canvas counterpart.
  * 
  * The Mesh origin is always 0.5 x 0.5 and cannot be changed.
