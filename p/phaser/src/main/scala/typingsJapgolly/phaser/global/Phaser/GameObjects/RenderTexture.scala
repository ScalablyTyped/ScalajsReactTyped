/**
  * A Render Texture.
  * 
  * A Render Texture is a special texture that allows any number of Game Objects to be drawn to it. You can take many complex objects and
  * draw them all to this one texture, which can they be used as the texture for other Game Object's. It's a way to generate dynamic
  * textures at run-time that are WebGL friendly and don't invoke expensive GPU uploads.
  * 
  * Note that under WebGL a FrameBuffer, which is what the Render Texture uses internally, cannot be anti-aliased. This means
  * that when drawing objects such as Shapes to a Render Texture they will appear to be drawn with no aliasing, however this
  * is a technical limitation of WebGL. To get around it, create your shape as a texture in an art package, then draw that
  * to the Render Texture.
