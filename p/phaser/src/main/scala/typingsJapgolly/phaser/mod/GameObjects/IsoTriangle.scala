/**
  * The IsoTriangle Shape is a Game Object that can be added to a Scene, Group or Container. You can
  * treat it like any other Game Object in your game, such as tweening it, scaling it, or enabling
  * it for input or physics. It provides a quick and easy way for you to render this shape in your
  * game without using a texture, while still taking advantage of being fully batched in WebGL.
  * 
  * This shape supports only fill colors and cannot be stroked.
  * 
  * An IsoTriangle is an 'isometric' triangle. Think of it like a pyramid. Each face has a different
  * fill color. You can set the color of the top, left and right faces of the triangle respectively
  * You can also choose which of the faces are rendered via the `showTop`, `showLeft` and `showRight` properties.
  * 
  * You cannot view an IsoTriangle from under-neath, however you can change the 'angle' by setting
  * the `projection` property. The `reversed` property controls if the IsoTriangle is rendered upside
  * down or not.
