      * 'Game Object ignore capable' Cameras. Any Cameras beyond 31 that you create will all be given a Camera ID of
      * zero, meaning that they cannot be used for Game Object exclusion. This means if you need your Camera to ignore
      * Game Objects, make sure it's one of the first 31 created.
