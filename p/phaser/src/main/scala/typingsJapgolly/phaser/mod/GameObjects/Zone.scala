/**
  * A Zone Game Object.
  * 
  * A Zone is a non-rendering rectangular Game Object that has a position and size.
  * It has no texture and never displays, but does live on the display list and
  * can be moved, scaled and rotated like any other Game Object.
  * 
  * Its primary use is for creating Drop Zones and Input Hit Areas and it has a couple of helper methods
  * specifically for this. It is also useful for object overlap checks, or as a base for your own
  * non-displaying Game Objects.
  * The default origin is 0.5, the center of the Zone, the same as with Game Objects.
