/**
  * A Graphics object is a way to draw primitive shapes to your game. Primitives include forms of geometry, such as
  * Rectangles, Circles, and Polygons. They also include lines, arcs and curves. When you initially create a Graphics
  * object it will be empty.
  * 
  * To draw to it you must first specify a line style or fill style (or both), draw shapes using paths, and finally
  * fill or stroke them. For example:
  * 
  * ```javascript
  * graphics.lineStyle(5, 0xFF00FF, 1.0);
  * graphics.beginPath();
  * graphics.moveTo(100, 100);
  * graphics.lineTo(200, 200);
  * graphics.closePath();
  * graphics.strokePath();
  * ```
  * 
  * There are also many helpful methods that draw and fill/stroke common shapes for you.
  * 
  * ```javascript
  * graphics.lineStyle(5, 0xFF00FF, 1.0);
  * graphics.fillStyle(0xFFFFFF, 1.0);
  * graphics.fillRect(50, 50, 400, 200);
  * graphics.strokeRect(50, 50, 400, 200);
  * ```
  * 
  * When a Graphics object is rendered it will render differently based on if the game is running under Canvas or WebGL.
  * Under Canvas it will use the HTML Canvas context drawing operations to draw the path.
  * Under WebGL the graphics data is decomposed into polygons. Both of these are expensive processes, especially with
  * complex shapes.
  * 
  * If your Graphics object doesn't change much (or at all) once you've drawn your shape to it, then you will help
  * performance by calling {@link Phaser.GameObjects.Graphics#generateTexture}. This will 'bake' the Graphics object into
  * a Texture, and return it. You can then use this Texture for Sprites or other display objects. If your Graphics object
  * updates frequently then you should avoid doing this, as it will constantly generate new textures, which will consume
  * memory.
  * 
  * As you can tell, Graphics objects are a bit of a trade-off. While they are extremely useful, you need to be careful
  * in their complexity and quantity of them in your game.
