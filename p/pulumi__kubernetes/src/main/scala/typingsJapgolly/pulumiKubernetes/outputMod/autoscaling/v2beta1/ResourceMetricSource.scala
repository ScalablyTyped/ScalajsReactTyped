  * ResourceMetricSource indicates how to scale on a resource metric known to Kubernetes, as

  * or memory).  The values will be averaged together before being compared to the target.  Such
  * metrics are built in to Kubernetes, and have special scaling options on top of those
  * available to normal per-pod metrics using the "pods" source.  Only one "target" type should
