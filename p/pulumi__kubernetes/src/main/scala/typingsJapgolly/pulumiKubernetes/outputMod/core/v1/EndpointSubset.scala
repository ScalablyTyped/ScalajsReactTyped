/**
  * EndpointSubset is a group of addresses with a common set of ports. The expanded set of
  * endpoints is the Cartesian product of Addresses x Ports. For example, given:
  *   {
  *     Addresses: [{"ip": "10.10.1.1"}, {"ip": "10.10.2.2"}],
  *     Ports:     [{"name": "a", "port": 8675}, {"name": "b", "port": 309}]
  *   }
  * The resulting set of endpoints can be viewed as:
  *     a: [ 10.10.1.1:8675, 10.10.2.2:8675 ],
  *     b: [ 10.10.1.1:309, 10.10.2.2:309 ]
