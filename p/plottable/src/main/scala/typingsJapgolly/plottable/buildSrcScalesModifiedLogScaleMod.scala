  /**
    * A ModifiedLog Scale acts as a regular log scale for large numbers.
    * As it approaches 0, it gradually becomes linear.
    * Consequently, a ModifiedLog Scale can process 0 and negative numbers.
    *
    * For x >= base, scale(x) = log(x).
    *
    * For 0 < x < base, scale(x) will become more and more
    * linear as it approaches 0.
    *
    * At x == 0, scale(x) == 0.
    *
    * For negative values, scale(-x) = -scale(x).
    *
    * The range and domain for the scale should also be set, using the
    * range() and domain() accessors, respectively.
    *
    * For `range`, provide a two-element array giving the minimum and
    * maximum of values produced when scaling.
    *
    * For `domain` provide a two-element array giving the minimum and
    * maximum of the values that will be scaled.
    *
