For more information, see "[Checking mergeability of pull requests](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)".
    *
    * The value of the `mergeable` attribute can be `true`, `false`, or `null`. If the value is `null`, then GitHub has started a background job to compute the mergeability.

If `mergeable` is `true`, then `merge_commit_sha` will be the SHA of the _test_ merge commit.

    *
