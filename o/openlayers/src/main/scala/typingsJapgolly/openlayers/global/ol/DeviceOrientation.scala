  * @classdesc
  * The ol.DeviceOrientation class provides access to information from
  * DeviceOrientation events.  See the [HTML 5 DeviceOrientation Specification](
  * http://www.w3.org/TR/orientation-event/) for more details.
  *
  * Many new computers, and especially mobile phones
  * and tablets, provide hardware support for device orientation. Web
  * developers targeting mobile devices will be especially interested in this
  * class.
  *
  * Device orientation data are relative to a common starting point. For mobile
  * devices, the starting point is to lay your phone face up on a table with the
  * top of the phone pointing north. This represents the zero state. All
  * angles are then relative to this state. For computers, it is the same except
  * the screen is open at 90 degrees.
  *
  * Device orientation is reported as three angles - `alpha`, `beta`, and
  * `gamma` - relative to the starting position along the three planar axes X, Y
  * and Z. The X axis runs from the left edge to the right edge through the
  * middle of the device. Similarly, the Y axis runs from the bottom to the top
  * of the device through the middle. The Z axis runs from the back to the front
  * through the middle. In the starting position, the X axis points to the
  * right, the Y axis points away from you and the Z axis points straight up
  * from the device lying flat.
  *
  * The three angles representing the device orientation are relative to the
  * three axes. `alpha` indicates how much the device has been rotated around the
  * Z axis, which is commonly interpreted as the compass heading (see note
  * below). `beta` indicates how much the device has been rotated around the X
  * axis, or how much it is tilted from front to back.  `gamma` indicates how
  * much the device has been rotated around the Y axis, or how much it is tilted
  * from left to right.
  *
  * For most browsers, the `alpha` value returns the compass heading so if the
  * device points north, it will be 0.  With Safari on iOS, the 0 value of
  * `alpha` is calculated from when device orientation was first requested.
  * ol.DeviceOrientation provides the `heading` property which normalizes this
  * behavior across all browsers for you.
  *
  * It is important to note that the HTML 5 DeviceOrientation specification
  * indicates that `alpha`, `beta` and `gamma` are in degrees while the
  * equivalent properties in ol.DeviceOrientation are in radians for consistency
  * with all other uses of angles throughout OpenLayers.
  *
  * To get notified of device orientation changes, register a listener for the
  * generic `change` event on your `ol.DeviceOrientation` instance.
