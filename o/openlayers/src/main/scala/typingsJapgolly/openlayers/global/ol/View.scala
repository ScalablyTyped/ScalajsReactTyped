/**
  * @classdesc
  * An ol.View object represents a simple 2D view of the map.
  *
  * This is the object to act upon to change the center, resolution,
  * and rotation of the map.
  *
  * ### The view states
  *
  * An `ol.View` is determined by three states: `center`, `resolution`,
  * and `rotation`. Each state has a corresponding getter and setter, e.g.
  * `getCenter` and `setCenter` for the `center` state.
  *
  * An `ol.View` has a `projection`. The projection determines the
  * coordinate system of the center, and its units determine the units of the
  * resolution (projection units per pixel). The default projection is
  * Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).
  *
  * ### The constraints
  *
  * `setCenter`, `setResolution` and `setRotation` can be used to change the
  * states of the view. Any value can be passed to the setters. And the value
  * that is passed to a setter will effectively be the value set in the view,
  * and returned by the corresponding getter.
  *
  * But an `ol.View` object also has a *resolution constraint*, a
  * *rotation constraint* and a *center constraint*.
  *
  * As said above, no constraints are applied when the setters are used to set
  * new states for the view. Applying constraints is done explicitly through
  * the use of the `constrain*` functions (`constrainResolution` and
  * `constrainRotation` and `constrainCenter`).
  *
  * The main users of the constraints are the interactions and the
  * controls. For example, double-clicking on the map changes the view to
  * the "next" resolution. And releasing the fingers after pinch-zooming
  * snaps to the closest resolution (with an animation).
  *
  * The *resolution constraint* snaps to specific resolutions. It is
  * determined by the following options: `resolutions`, `maxResolution`,
  * `maxZoom`, and `zoomFactor`. If `resolutions` is set, the other three
  * options are ignored. See documentation for each option for more
  * information.
  *
  * The *rotation constraint* snaps to specific angles. It is determined
  * by the following options: `enableRotation` and `constrainRotation`.
  * By default the rotation value is snapped to zero when approaching the
  * horizontal.
  *
  * The *center constraint* is determined by the `extent` option. By
  * default the center is not constrained at all.
  *
  * @param opt_options View options.
