      * out the route which matches the hash

      * necessarily trigger the matching process of this route. In the end, the first route in the router configuration
      * list that matches the browser hash will be chosen.
      *
      * If the browser hash is already set with the interpolated pattern from the navTo call, nothing will happen
      * because the browser won't fire `hashchange` event in this case.
