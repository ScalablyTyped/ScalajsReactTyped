    /**
      * Collects accessibility related attributes for an `Element` and renders them as part of the currently
      * rendered DOM element.
      *
      * See the WAI-ARIA specification for a general description of the accessibility related attributes. Attributes
      * are only rendered when the accessibility feature is activated in the UI5 runtime configuration.
      *
      * The values for the attributes are collected from the following sources (last one wins):
      * 	 - from the properties and associations of the given `oElement`, using a heuristic mapping (described
      * 			below)
      * 	 - from the `mProps` parameter, as provided by the caller
      * 	 - from the parent of the given `oElement`, if it has a parent and if the parent implements the method
      * 			{@link sap.ui.core.Element#enhanceAccessibilityState enhanceAccessibilityState}  If no `oElement`
      * 			is given, only `mProps` will be taken into account.
      *
      * Heuristic Mapping: The following mapping from properties/values to ARIA attributes is used (if the element
      * does have such properties):
      * 	 - `editable===false` => `aria-readonly="true"`
      * 	 - `enabled===false` => `aria-disabled="true"`
      * 	 - `visible===false` => `aria-hidden="true"`
      * 	 - `required===true` => `aria-required="true"`
      * 	 - `selected===true` => `aria-selected="true"`
      * 	 - `checked===true` => `aria-checked="true"`
      *
      * In case of the `required` property, all label controls which reference the given element in their `labelFor`
      * relation are additionally taken into account when determining the value for the `aria-required` attribute.
      *
      * Additionally, the associations `ariaDescribedBy` and `ariaLabelledBy` are used to determine the lists
      * of IDs for the ARIA attributes `aria-describedby` and `aria-labelledby`.
      *
      * Label controls that reference the given element in their `labelFor` relation are automatically added
      * to the `aria-labelledby` attribute.
      *
      * Note: This function is only a heuristic of a control property to ARIA attribute mapping. Control developers
      * have to check whether it fulfills their requirements. In case of problems (for example the `RadioButton`
      * has a `selected` property but must provide an `aria-checked` attribute) the auto-generated result of
      * this function can be influenced via the parameter `mProps` as described below.
      *
      * The parameter `mProps` can be used to either provide additional attributes which should be rendered and/or
      * to avoid the automatic generation of single ARIA attributes. The 'aria-' prefix will be prepended automatically
      * to the keys (Exception: Attribute `role` does not get the prefix 'aria-').
      *
      * Examples:
      *  `{hidden : true}` results in `aria-hidden="true"` independent of the presence or absence of the visibility
      * property.
      *  `{hidden : null}` ensures that no `aria-hidden` attribute is written independent of the presence or
      * absence of the visibility property.
      *
      *
      * The function behaves in the same way for the associations `ariaDescribedBy` and `ariaLabelledBy`. To
      * append additional values to the auto-generated `aria-describedby` and `aria-labelledby` attributes, the
      * following format can be used:
      * ```javascript
      *
      *   {describedby : {value: "id1 id2", append: true}} =>  aria-describedby = "ida idb id1 id2"
      * ```
      *  (assuming that "ida idb" is the auto-generated part based on the association `ariaDescribedBy`).

      *
      * Cleans up the rendering state of the given control without rendering it.
      *
      * A control is responsible for the rendering of all its child controls. But in some cases it makes sense
      * that a control only renders a subset of its children based on some criterion. For example, a typical
      * carousel control might, for performance reasons, only render the currently visible children (and maybe
      * some child before and after the visible area to facilitate slide-in / slide-out animations), but not
      * all children. This leads to situations where a child had been rendered before, but shouldn't be rendered
      * anymore after an update of the carousel's position. The DOM related state of that child then must be
      * cleaned up correctly, e.g. by de-registering resize handlers or native event handlers. `cleanupControlWithoutRendering`
      * helps with that task by triggering the same activities that the normal rendering triggers before the
      * rendering of a control (e.g. it fires the `BeforeRendering` event). It just doesn't call the renderer
      * and the control will not receive an `AfterRendering` event.
      *
      * The following example shows how `renderControl` and `cleanupControlWithoutRendering` should be used:
      *
      *
      * ```javascript
      *
      *   CarouselRenderer.render = function(rm, oCarousel){
      *
      *     ...
      *
      *     oCarousel.getPages().forEach( function( oPage ) {
      *        if ( oCarousel.isPageToBeRendered( oPage ) ) {
      *           rm.renderControl( oPage ); // onBeforeRendering, render, later onAfterRendering
      *        } else {
      *           rm.cleanupControlWithoutRendering( oPage ); // onBeforeRendering
      *        }
      *     });
      *
      *     ...
      *
      *   };
      * ```
      *
      *
      * DOM Removal: The method does not remove the DOM of the given control. The caller of this method has to
      * take care to remove it at some later point in time. It should indeed be later, not before
      * as the `onBeforeRendering` hook of the control might need access to the old DOM for a proper cleanup.
      *
      * For parents which are rendered with the normal mechanism as shown in the example above, the removal of
      * the old child DOM is guaranteed. The whole DOM of the parent control (including the DOM of the no longer
      * rendered child) will be replaced with new DOM (no longer containing the child) when the rendering cycle
      * finishes.
      *
      * **Note:**: the functionality of this method is different from the default handling for invisible controls
      * (controls with `visible == false`). The standard rendering for invisible controls still renders a placeholder
      * DOM. This allows re-rendering of the invisible control once it becomes visible again without a need to
      * render its parent, too. Children that are cleaned up with this method here, are supposed to have no more
      * DOM at all. Rendering them later on therefore requires an involvement (typically: a rendering) of their
      * parent.

      * sap.ui.core.RenderManager Semantic Rendering API}.
      *
      * Collects accessibility related attributes for an `Element` and renders them as part of the currently
      * rendered DOM element.
      *
      * See the WAI-ARIA specification for a general description of the accessibility related attributes. Attributes
      * are only rendered when the accessibility feature is activated in the UI5 runtime configuration.
      *
      * The values for the attributes are collected from the following sources (last one wins):
      * 	 - from the properties and associations of the given `oElement`, using a heuristic mapping (described
      * 			below)
      * 	 - from the `mProps` parameter, as provided by the caller
      * 	 - from the parent of the given `oElement`, if it has a parent and if the parent implements the method
      * 			{@link sap.ui.core.Element#enhanceAccessibilityState enhanceAccessibilityState}  If no `oElement`
      * 			is given, only `mProps` will be taken into account.
      *
      * Heuristic Mapping: The following mapping from properties/values to ARIA attributes is used (if the element
      * does have such properties):
      * 	 - `editable===false` => `aria-readonly="true"`
      * 	 - `enabled===false` => `aria-disabled="true"`
      * 	 - `visible===false` => `aria-hidden="true"`
      * 	 - `required===true` => `aria-required="true"`
      * 	 - `selected===true` => `aria-selected="true"`
      * 	 - `checked===true` => `aria-checked="true"`
      *
      * In case of the `required` property, all label controls which reference the given element in their `labelFor`
      * relation are additionally taken into account when determining the value for the `aria-required` attribute.
      *
      * Additionally, the associations `ariaDescribedBy` and `ariaLabelledBy` are used to determine the lists
      * of IDs for the ARIA attributes `aria-describedby` and `aria-labelledby`.
      *
      * Label controls that reference the given element in their `labelFor` relation are automatically added
      * to the `aria-labelledby` attributes.
      *
      * Note: This function is only a heuristic of a control property to ARIA attribute mapping. Control developers
      * have to check whether it fulfills their requirements. In case of problems (for example the `RadioButton`
      * has a `selected` property but must provide an `aria-checked` attribute) the auto-generated result of
      * this function can be influenced via the parameter `mProps` as described below.
      *
      * The parameter `mProps` can be used to either provide additional attributes which should be rendered and/or
      * to avoid the automatic generation of single ARIA attributes. The 'aria-' prefix will be prepended automatically
      * to the keys (Exception: Attribute `role` does not get the prefix 'aria-').
      *
      * Examples:
      *  `{hidden : true}` results in `aria-hidden="true"` independent of the presence or absence of the visibility
      * property.
      *  `{hidden : null}` ensures that no `aria-hidden` attribute is written independent of the presence or
      * absence of the visibility property.
      *
      *
      * The function behaves in the same way for the associations `ariaDescribedBy` and `ariaLabelledBy`. To
      * append additional values to the auto-generated `aria-describedby` and `aria-labelledby` attributes, the
      * following format can be used:
      * ```javascript
      *
      *   {describedby : {value: "id1 id2", append: true}} =>  aria-describedby = "ida idb id1 id2"
      * ```
      *  (assuming that "ida idb" is the auto-generated part based on the association `ariaDescribedBy`).
