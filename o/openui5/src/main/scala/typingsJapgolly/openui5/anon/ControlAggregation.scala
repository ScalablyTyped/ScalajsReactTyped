  /**
    * A reference to another target, using the name of the target. If you display a target that has a parent,
    * the parent will also be displayed. Also the control you specify with the controlId parameter, will be
    * searched inside of the created instance of the parent not in the rootView, provided in the config. The
    * control will be searched using the byId function of a view. When it is not found, the global id is checked.
    *
    *  The main usecase for the parent property is placing a view or component inside a smaller container of
    * an instance, which is also created by targets. This is useful for lazy loading views or components, only
    * if the user really navigates to this part of your application.
    *  **Example:** Our aim is to lazy load a tab of an IconTabBar (a control that displays a view initially
    * and when a user clicks on it the view changes). It's a perfect candidate to lazy load something inside
    * of it.
    *  **Example app structure:**
    *  We have a rootView that is returned by the createContent function of our UIComponent. This view contains
    * an sap.m.App control with the id 'myApp'
    * ```javascript
    *
    *
    * <View xmlns="sap.m">
    *     <App id="myApp"/>
    * </View>
    *
    * ```
    *  an xml view called 'Detail'
    * ```javascript
    *
    *
    * <View xmlns="sap.m">
    *     <IconTabBar>
    *         <items>
    *             <IconTabFilter>
    *                 <!-- content of our first tab -->
    *             <IconTabFilter>
    *             <IconTabFilter id="mySecondTab">
    *                 <!-- nothing here, since we will lazy load this one with a target -->
    *             <IconTabFilter>
    *         </items>
    *     </IconTabBar>
    * </View>
    *
    * ```
    *  and a view called 'SecondTabContent', this one contains our content we want to have lazy loaded. Now
    * we need to create our Targets instance with a config matching our app:
    * ```javascript
    *
    *
    *     new Targets({
    *         //Creates our views except for root, we created this one before - when using a component you
    *         views: new Views(),
    *         config: {
    *             // all of our views have that type
    *             viewType: 'XML',
    *             // a reference to the app control in the rootView created by our UIComponent
    *             controlId: 'myApp',
    *             // An app has a pages aggregation where the views need to be put into
    *             controlAggregation: 'pages'
    *         },
    *         targets: {
    *             detail: {
    *                 type: "View",
    *                 name: 'Detail'
    *             },
    *             secondTabContent: {
    *                 // A reference to the detail target defined above
    *                 parent: 'detail',
    *                 // A reference to the second Tab container in the Detail view. Here the target does not look in the rootView, it looks in the Parent view (Detail).
    *                 controlId: 'mySecondTab',
    *                 // An IconTabFilter has an aggregation called content so we need to overwrite the pages set in the config as default.
    *                 controlAggregation: 'content',
    *                 // A view containing the content
    *                 type: "View",
    *                 name: 'SecondTabContent'
    *             }
    *         }
    *     });
    *
    * ```
    *
    *
    * Now if we call ` oTargets.display("secondTabContent") `, 2 views will be created: Detail and SecondTabContent.
    * The 'Detail' view will be put into the pages aggregation of the App. And afterwards the 'SecondTabContent'
    * view will be put into the content Aggregation of the second IconTabFilter. So a parent will always be
    * created before the target referencing it.
