  /**
    * @SINCE 1.58
    *
    * A Logging API for JavaScript.
    *
    * Provides methods to manage a client-side log and to create entries in it. Each of the logging methods
    * {@link module:sap/base/Log.debug}, {@link module:sap/base/Log.info}, {@link module:sap/base/Log.warning},
    * {@link module:sap/base/Log.error} and {@link module:sap/base/Log.fatal} creates and records a log entry,
    * containing a timestamp, a log level, a message with details and a component info. The log level will
    * be one of {@link module:sap/base/Log.Level} and equals the name of the concrete logging method.
    *
    * By using the {@link module:sap/base/Log.setLevel} method, consumers can determine the least important
    * log level which should be recorded. Less important entries will be filtered out. (Note that higher numeric
    * values represent less important levels). The initially set level depends on the mode that UI5 is running
    * in. When the optimized sources are executed, the default level will be {@link module:sap/base/Log.Level.ERROR}.
    * For normal (debug sources), the default level is {@link module:sap/base/Log.Level.DEBUG}.
    *
    * All logging methods allow to specify a **component**. These components are simple strings and don't have
    * a special meaning to the UI5 framework. However they can be used to semantically group log entries that
    * belong to the same software component (or feature). There are two APIs that help to manage logging for
    * such a component. With {@link module:sap/base/Log.getLogger}, one can retrieve a logger that automatically
    * adds the given `sComponent` as component parameter to each log entry, if no other component is specified.
    * Typically, JavaScript code will retrieve such a logger once during startup and reuse it for the rest
    * of its lifecycle. Second, the {@link module:sap/base/Log.setLevel}(iLevel, sComponent) method allows
    * to set the log level for a specific component only. This allows a more fine grained control about the
    * created logging entries. {@link module:sap/base/Log.getLevel} allows to retrieve the currently effective
    * log level for a given component.
    *
    * {@link module:sap/base/Log.getLogEntries} returns an array of the currently collected log entries.
    *
    * Furthermore, a listener can be registered to the log. It will be notified whenever a new entry is added
    * to the log. The listener can be used for displaying log entries in a separate page area, or for sending
    * it to some external target (server).
