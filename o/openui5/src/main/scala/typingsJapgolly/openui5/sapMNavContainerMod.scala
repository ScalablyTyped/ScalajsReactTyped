      * Adds a custom transition to the NavContainer type (not to a particular instance!). The transition is
      * identified by a "name". Make sure to only use names that will not collide with transitions which may
      * be added to the NavContainer later. A suggestion is to use the prefix "c_" or "_" for your custom transitions
      * to ensure this.
      *
      * "to" and "back" are the transition functions for the forward and backward navigation. Both will be called
      * with the following parameters: - oFromPage: the Control which is currently being displayed by the NavContainer
      * - oToPage: the Control which should be displayed by the NavContainer after the transition - fCallback:
      * a function which MUST be called when the transition has completed - oTransitionParameters: a data object
      * that can be given by application code when triggering the transition by calling to() or back(); this
      * object could give additional information to the transition function, like the DOM element which triggered
      * the transition or the desired transition duration
      *
      * The contract for "to" and "back" is that they may do an animation of their choice, but it should not
      * take "too long". At the beginning of the transition the target page "oToPage" does have the CSS class
      * "sapMNavItemHidden" which initially hides the target page (visibility:hidden). The transition can do
      * any preparation (e.g. move that page out of the screen or make it transparent) and then should remove
      * this CSS class. After the animation the target page "oToPage" should cover the entire screen and the
      * source page "oFromPage" should not be visible anymore. This page should then have the CSS class "sapMNavItemHidden".
      * For adding/removing this or other CSS classes, the transition can use the addStyleClass/removeStyleClass
      * method: oFromPage.addStyleClass("sapMNavItemHidden"); When the transition is complete, it MUST call the
      * given fCallback method to inform the NavContainer that navigation has finished!
      *
      * Hint: if the target page of your transition stays black on iPhone, try wrapping the animation start into
      * a setTimeout(..., 0) block (delayed, but without waiting).
      *
      * This method can be called on any NavContainer instance or statically on the sap.m.NavContainer type.
      * However, the transition will always be registered for the type (and ALL instances), not for the single
      * instance on which this method was invoked.
      *
      * Returns the sap.m.NavContainer type if called statically, or "this" (to allow method chaining) if called
      * on a particular NavContainer instance.
