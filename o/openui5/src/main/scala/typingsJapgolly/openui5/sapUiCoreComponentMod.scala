      *       "myLocalServiceAlias": {
      *         "factoryName": "my.ServiceFactory",
      *         ["optional": true]
      *       }

      *  The service declaration is used to define a mapping between the local alias for the service that can
      * be used in the Component and the name of the service factory which will be used to create a service instance.
      *
      * The `getService` function will look up the service factory and will create a new instance by using the
      * service factory function {@link sap.ui.core.service.ServiceFactory#createInstance createInstance} The
      * optional property defines that the service is not mandatory and the usage will not depend on the availability
      * of this service. When requesting an optional service the `getService` function will reject but there
      * will be no error logged in the console.
      *
      * When creating a new instance of the service the Component context will be passed as `oServiceContext`
      * as follows:
      * ```javascript
      *
      * {
      *   "scopeObject": this,     // the Component instance
      *   "scopeType": "component" // the stereotype of the scopeObject
      * }
      * ```
      *
      *
      * The service will be created only once per Component and reused in future calls to the `getService` function.
      *  This function will return a `Promise` which provides the service interface when resolved. If the
      * `factoryName` could not be found in the {@link sap.ui.core.service.ServiceFactoryRegistry Service Factory
      * Registry} or the service declaration in the descriptor for components (manifest.json) is missing the
      * Promise will reject.
      *
      * This is an example of how the `getService` function can be used:
      * ```javascript
      *
      * oComponent.getService("myLocalServiceAlias").then(function(oService) {
      *   oService.doSomething();
      * }).catch(function(oError) {
      *   Log.error(oError);
      * });
      * ```
      *
      *
      * @returns Promise which will be resolved with the Service interface
