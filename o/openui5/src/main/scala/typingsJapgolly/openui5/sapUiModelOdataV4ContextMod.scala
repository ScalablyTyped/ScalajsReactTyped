      * implicit loading is switched off via the binding-specific parameter `$$patchWithoutSideEffects`. The

      * 	 the bound context of a context binding,  the return value context of an operation binding,
      * a context of a list binding representing a single entity,  the header context of a list binding;
      * side effects are loaded for the whole binding in this case.  Key predicates must be available in
      * this context's path. Avoid navigation properties as part of a binding's $select system query option as
      * they may trigger pointless requests. There must be only context bindings between this context and its
      * first ancestor binding which uses own data service requests.
      *
      * If the first ancestor binding has an empty path, it is a context binding. In this case, we look for the
      * farthest ancestor binding with the following characteristics: It uses own data service requests, it can
      * be reached via a sequence of only empty paths, and it is actually being used. This way, side effects
      * are loaded also for siblings of that first ancestor binding which show the same data, but useless requests
      * are avoided.
      *
      * By default, the request uses the update group ID for this context's binding; this way, it can easily
      * be part of the same batch request as the corresponding update. **Caution:** If a dependent binding uses
      * a different update group ID, it may lose its pending changes. The same will happen if a different group
      * ID is provided, and the side effects affect properties for which there are pending changes.
      *
      * All failed updates or creates for the group ID are repeated within the same batch request. If the group
      * ID has submit mode {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.SubmitMode.Auto} and there are currently running updates
      * or creates this method first waits for them to be processed.
      *
      * The events 'dataRequested' and 'dataReceived' are not fired. Whatever should happen in the event handler
      * attached to...
      * 	 'dataRequested', can instead be done before calling {@link #requestSideEffects}.  'dataReceived',
      * can instead be done once the `oPromise` returned by {@link #requestSideEffects} fulfills or rejects (using
      * `oPromise.then(function () {...}, function () {...})`).

      * effects.
