      *

      * starting with "@" (that is, an annotation) is appended without a separator. Use "./" as a prefix for
      * such a relative path to enforce a separator.
      *
      * Example:
      * ```javascript
      *
      * <template:with path="/EMPLOYEES/ENTRYDATE" var="property">
      *   <!-- /EMPLOYEES/ENTRYDATE/$Type -->
      *   "{property>$Type}"
      *
      *   <!-- /EMPLOYEES/ENTRYDATE@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text -->
      *   "{property>@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text}"
      *
      *   <!-- /EMPLOYEES/ENTRYDATE/@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text -->
      *   "{property>./@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text}"
      * </template:with>
      * ```
      *
      *
      * The basic idea is that every path described in "14.2.1 Attribute Target" in specification "OData Version 4.0 Part 3: Common Schema Definition Language"
      * is a valid absolute path within the metadata model if a leading slash is added; for example "/" + "MySchema.MyEntityContainer/MyEntitySet/MyComplexProperty/MyNavigationProperty".
      * Also, every path described in "14.5.2 Expression edm:AnnotationPath", "14.5.11 Expression edm:NavigationPropertyPath",
      * "14.5.12 Expression edm:Path", and "14.5.13 Expression edm:PropertyPath" is a valid relative path within
      * the metadata model if a suitable prefix is added which addresses an entity container, entity set, singleton,
      * complex type, entity type, or property; for example "/MySchema.MyEntityType/MyProperty" + "@vCard.Address#work/FullName".
      *
      * The absolute path is split into segments and followed step-by-step, starting at the global scope of all
      * known qualified OData names. There are two technical properties there: "$Version" (typically "4.0") and
      * "$EntityContainer" with the name of the single entity container for this metadata model's service.
      *
      * An empty segment in between is invalid, except to force return type lookup for operation overloads (see
      * below). An empty segment at the end caused by a trailing slash differentiates between a name and the
      * object it refers to. This way, "/$EntityContainer" refers to the name of the single entity container
      * and "/$EntityContainer/" refers to the single entity container as an object.
      *
      * The segment "@sapui.name" refers back to the last OData name (simple identifier or qualified name) or
      * annotation name encountered during path traversal immediately before "@sapui.name":
      * 	 "/EMPLOYEES@sapui.name" results in "EMPLOYEES" and "/EMPLOYEES/@sapui.name" results in the same as
      * "/EMPLOYEES/$Type", that is, the qualified name of the entity set's type (see below how "$Type" is inserted
      * implicitly). Note how the separating slash again makes a difference here.  "/EMPLOYEES/@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Label@sapui.name"
      * results in "@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Label" and a slash does not make any difference as long as
      * the annotation does not have a "$Type" property.  A technical property (that is, a numerical segment
      * or one starting with a "$") immediately before "@sapui.name" is invalid, for example "/$EntityContainer@sapui.name".
      *  The path must not continue after "@sapui.name".
      *
      * If the current object is a string value, that string value is treated as a relative path and followed
      * step-by-step before the next segment is processed. Except for this, a path must not continue if it comes
      * across a non-object value. Such a string value can be a qualified name (example path "/$EntityContainer/..."),
      * a simple identifier (example path "/TEAMS/$NavigationPropertyBinding/TEAM_2_EMPLOYEES/...") including
      * the special name "$ReturnType" (since 1.71.0), or even a path according to "14.5.12 Expression edm:Path"
      * etc. (example path "/TEAMS/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem/0/Value/$Path/...".
      *
      * Segments starting with an "@" character, for example "@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Label", address
      * annotations at the current object. As the first segment, they refer to the single entity container. For
      * objects which can only be annotated inline (see "14.3 Element edm:Annotation" minus "14.2.1 Attribute
      * Target"), the object already contains the annotations as a property. For objects which can (only or also)
      * be annotated via external targeting, the object does not contain any annotation as a property. Such annotations
      * MUST be accessed via a path. Such objects include operations (that is, actions and functions) and their
      * parameters, which can be annotated for a single overload or for all overloads at the same time.
      *
      * Segments starting with an OData name followed by an "@" character, for example "/TEAMS@Org.OData.Capabilities.V1.TopSupported",
      * address annotations at an entity set, singleton, or property, not at the corresponding type. In contrast,
      * "/TEAMS/@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Deletable" (note the separating slash) addresses an annotation
      * at the entity set's type. This is in line with the special rule of "14.5.12 Expression edm:Path" regarding
      * annotations at a navigation property itself.
      *
      * "@" can be used as a segment to address a map of all annotations of the current object. This is useful
      * for iteration, for example via `<template:repeat list="{entityType>@}" ...>`.
      *
      * Annotations of an annotation are addressed not by two separate segments, but by a single segment like
      * "@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.TextArrangement". Each annotation
      * can have a qualifier, for example "@first#foo@second#bar". Note: If the first annotation's value is a
      * record, a separate segment addresses an annotation of that record, not an annotation of the first annotation
      * itself. In a similar way, annotations of "7.2 Element edm:ReferentialConstraint", "7.3 Element edm:OnDelete",
      * "10.2 Element edm:Member" and "14.5.14.2 Element edm:PropertyValue" are addressed by segments like "<7.2.1
      * Attribute Property>@...", "$OnDelete@...", "<10.2.1 Attribute Name>@..." and "<14.5.14.2.1 Attribute
      * Property>@..." (where angle brackets denote a variable part and sections refer to specification "OData Version 4.0 Part 3:
      * Common Schema Definition Language").
      *
      * Annotations starting with "@@", for example "@@sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.isMultiple" or
      * "@@.AH.isMultiple" or "@@.isMultiple", represent computed annotations. Their name without the "@@" prefix
      * must refer to a function in `mParameters.scope` in case of a relative name starting with a dot, which
      * is stripped before lookup; see the `<template:alias>` instruction for XML Templating. In case of an
      * absolute name, it is searched in `mParameters.scope` first and then in the global namespace. The names
      * "requestCurrencyCodes" and "requestUnitsOfMeasure" default to {@link #requestCurrencyCodes} and {@link
      * #requestUnitsOfMeasure} resp. if not present in `mParameters.scope`. This function is called with the
      * current object (or primitive value) and additional details and returns the result of this {@link #requestObject}
      * call. The additional details are given as an object with the following properties:
      * 	 `{boolean} $$valueAsPromise` Whether the computed annotation may return a `Promise` resolving with
      * its value (since 1.57.0)  `{@link sap.ui.model.Context} context` Points to the current object
      * `{object} overload` In case of annotations of an operation or a parameter, if filtering by binding parameter
      * determines a single operation overload, that overload is passed (since 1.71.0), else `undefined`
      * `{string} schemaChildName` The qualified name of the schema child where the computed annotation has been
      * found  Computed annotations cannot be iterated by "@". The path must not continue after a computed
      * annotation. Since 1.77.0, arguments can be given to a computed annotation much like a JavaScript function
      * call. The left parenthesis must immediately follow the name and no whitespace must follow the right parenthesis.
      * In between, a comma separated list of JSON values may be given (see `JSON.parse`); string literals may
      * be enclosed in single or double quotes; property names in object literals need not be quoted; curly brackets
      * must be replaced by `$(` and `$)` respectively, no matter where they appear, and there is no escaping
      * for `$(` and `$)` to prevent replacement back to curly brackets before parsing; as usual, `null` is supported
      * while `undefined` is not. Example: "@@AH.format($(style : 'short'$)))" or "@@AH.format(null, $($$noPatch
      * : true$)))".
      *
      * A segment which represents an OData qualified name is looked up in the global scope ("scope lookup")
      * and thus determines a schema child which is used later on. Unknown qualified names are invalid. This
      * way, "/acme.DefaultContainer/EMPLOYEES" addresses the "EMPLOYEES" child of the schema child named "acme.DefaultContainer".
      * This also works indirectly ("/$EntityContainer/EMPLOYEES") and implicitly ("/EMPLOYEES", see below).
      *
      * A segment which represents an OData simple identifier (or the special names "$ReturnType", since 1.71.0,
      * or "$Parameter", since 1.73.0) needs special preparations. The same applies to the empty segment after
      * a trailing slash.   If the current object has a "$Action", "$Function" or "$Type" property, it
      * is used for scope lookup first. This way, "/EMPLOYEES/ENTRYDATE" addresses the same object as "/EMPLOYEES/$Type/ENTRYDATE",
      * namely the "ENTRYDATE" child of the entity type corresponding to the "EMPLOYEES" child of the entity
      * container. The other cases jump from an operation import to the corresponding operation overloads.
      * Else if the segment is the first one within its path, the last schema child addressed via scope lookup
      * is used instead of the current object. This can only happen indirectly as in "/TEAMS/$NavigationPropertyBinding/TEAM_2_EMPLOYEES/..."
      * where the schema child is the entity container and the navigation property binding can contain the simple
      * identifier of another entity set within the same container.
      *
      * If the segment is the first one overall, "$EntityContainer" is inserted into the path implicitly. In
      * other words, the entity container is used as the initial schema child. This way, "/EMPLOYEES" addresses
      * the same object as "/$EntityContainer/EMPLOYEES", namely the "EMPLOYEES" child of the entity container.
      *  Afterwards, if the current object is an array, it represents overloads for an operation. Annotations
      * of an operation (since 1.71.0) or a parameter (since 1.66.0) can be immediately addressed, no matter
      * if they apply for a single overload or for all overloads at the same time, for example "/TEAMS/acme.NewAction@"
      * or "/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/Team_ID@". Annotations of an unbound operation overload can be addressed like
      * "/OperationImport/@$ui5.overload@", while "/OperationImport/@" addresses annotations of the operation
      * import itself. The special name "$ReturnType" can be used (since 1.71.0) like a parameter to address
      * annotations of the return type instead, for example "/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/$ReturnType@".
      *
      * Operation overloads are then filtered by binding parameter; multiple overloads after filtering are invalid
      * except if addressing all overloads via the segment "@$ui5.overload", for example "/acme.NewAction/@$ui5.overload".
      *
      * Once a single overload has been determined, its parameters can be immediately addressed, for example
      * "/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/Team_ID", or the special name "$Parameter" can be used (since 1.73.0), for example
      * "/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/$Parameter/Team_ID". The special name "$ReturnType" can be used (since 1.71.0)
      * like a parameter to address the return type instead, for example "/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/$ReturnType".
      * For all other names, the overload's "$ReturnType/$Type" is used for scope lookup. This way, "/GetOldestWorker/AGE"
      * addresses the same object as "/GetOldestWorker/$ReturnType/AGE" or "/GetOldestWorker/$Function/0/$ReturnType/$Type/AGE",
      * and "/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/MemberCount" (assuming "MemberCount" is not a parameter in this example) addresses
      * the same object as "/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/$ReturnType/MemberCount" or "/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/@$ui5.overload/0/$ReturnType/$Type/MemberCount".
      * In case a name can refer both to a parameter and to a property of the return type, an empty segment can
      * be used instead of "@$ui5.overload/0/$ReturnType/$Type" or "$ReturnType" to force return type lookup,
      * for example "/TEAMS/acme.NewAction//Team_ID".
      *
      * For primitive return types, the special segment "value" can be used to refer to the return type itself
      * (see {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding#execute}). This way, "/GetOldestAge/value" addresses
      * the same object as "/GetOldestAge/$ReturnType" or "/GetOldestAge/$Function/0/$ReturnType" or "/GetOldestAge/@$ui5.overload/0/$ReturnType"
      * (which is needed for automatic type determination, see {@link #requestUI5Type}).
      *
      * A trailing slash can be used to continue a path and thus force scope lookup or OData simple identifier
      * preparations, but then stay at the current object. This way, "/EMPLOYEES/$Type/" addresses the entity
      * type itself corresponding to the "EMPLOYEES" child of the entity container. Although the empty segment
      * is not an OData simple identifier, it can be used as a placeholder for one. In this way, "/EMPLOYEES/"
      * addresses the same entity type as "/EMPLOYEES/$Type/". That entity type in turn is a map of all its OData
      * children (that is, structural and navigation properties) and determines the set of possible child names
      * that might be used after the trailing slash.
      *
      * "$" can be used as the last segment to continue a path and thus force scope lookup, but no OData simple
      * identifier preparations. In this way, it serves as a placeholder for a technical property. The path must
      * not continue after "$", except for a computed annotation. Example: "/TEAMS/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem/0/Value/$Path/$"
      * addresses the referenced property itself, not the corresponding type like "/TEAMS/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem/0/Value/$Path/"
      * does. "/TEAMS/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem/0/Target/$NavigationPropertyPath/$@@.isMultiple" calls
      * a computed annotation on the navigation property itself, not on the corresponding type.
      *
      * Any other segment, including an OData simple identifier, is looked up as a property of the current object.
      * Segments which themselves represent a path, such as the keys for the "$ReferentialConstraint" and "$NavigationPropertyBinding"
      * maps, need to use URL encoding for the slash character ("%2F"), for example "/TEAMS/$NavigationPropertyBinding/Address%2FCountries/...".
