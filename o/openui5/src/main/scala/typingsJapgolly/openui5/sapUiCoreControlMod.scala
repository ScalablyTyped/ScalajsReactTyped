      * Defines a new subclass of Control with the name `sClassName` and enriches it with the information contained
      * in `oClassInfo`.
      *
      * `oClassInfo` can contain the same information that {@link sap.ui.core.Element.extend} already accepts,
      * plus the following `renderer` property:
      *
      * Example:
      * ```javascript
      *
      * Control.extend("sap.mylib.MyControl", {
      *   metadata : {
      *     library : "sap.mylib",
      *     properties : {
      *       text : "string",
      *       width : "sap.ui.core.CSSSize"
      *     }
      *   },
      *   renderer: {
      *     apiVersion: 2,
      *     render: function(oRM, oControl) {
      *       oRM.openStart("div", oControl);
      *       oRM.style("width", oControl.getWidth());
      *       oRM.openEnd();
      *       oRM.text(oControl.getText());
      *       oRM.close("div");
      *     }
      *   }
      * });
      * ```
      *
      *
      * There are multiple ways how a renderer can be specified:
      * 	 - As a **plain object**: The object will be used to create a new renderer by using {@link sap.ui.core.Renderer.extend}
      * 			to extend the renderer of the base class of this control. The new renderer will have the same global
      * 			name as this control class with the additional suffix 'Renderer'.
      *  **Note:** The `Renderer.extend` method expects a plain object (no prototype chain).
      * 	 - As a **function**: The given function will be used as `render` function of a new renderer; the renderer
      * 			will be created in the same way as described for the plain object case.
      * 	 - As a **ready-made renderer**, e.g. imported from the corresponding renderer module. As renderers
      * 			are simple objects (not instances of a specific class), some heuristic is used to distinguish renderers
      * 			from the plain object case above: An object is assumed to be a ready-made renderer when it has
      * 			a `render` function and either is already exposed under the expected global name or has an `extend` method.
      *
      * 	 - As a **fully qualified name**: The name will be looked up as a global property. If not defined, a
      * 			module name will be derived from the global name (dots replaced by slashes), the module will be required
      * 			and provides the renderer, either as AMD export or via the named global property.
      * 	 - **Omitting the `renderer` property** or setting it to `undefined`: The fully qualified name of the
      * 			renderer will be derived from the fully qualified name of the control by adding the suffix "Renderer".
      * 			The renderer then is retrieved in the same way as described for the fully qualified name case.
      *
      * 	 - **`null` or empty string**: The control will have no renderer, a call to `oControl.getMetadata().getRenderer()`
      * 			will return `undefined`.
      *
      * If the resulting renderer is incomplete (has no `render` function) or if it cannot be found at all, rendering
      * of the control will be skipped.
      *
      * **Note:** The `apiVersion: 2` flag is required to enable in-place rendering technology. Before setting
      * this property, please ensure that the constraints documented in section "Contract for Renderer.apiVersion
      * 2" of the {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager RenderManager} API documentation are fulfilled.
