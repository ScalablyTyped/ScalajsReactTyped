      * Creates a new entity and inserts it at the start or the end of the list.
      *
      * For creating the new entity, the binding's update group ID is used, see {@link #getUpdateGroupId}.
      *
      * You can call {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#delete} to delete the created context again. As long
      * as the context is {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#isTransient transient} and {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#isInactive
      * active}, {@link #resetChanges} and a call to {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#resetChanges} with
      * the update group ID as parameter also delete the created context together with other changes.
      *
      * If the creation of the entity on the server failed, the creation is repeated automatically. If the binding's
      * update group ID has {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.SubmitMode.API}, it is repeated with the next call of
      * {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#submitBatch}. Otherwise it is repeated with the next update for
      * the entity. Since 1.67.0, {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#submitBatch} can also be used for group
      * IDs with {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.SubmitMode.Auto} in order to repeat the creation even if there
      * is no update for the entity.
      *
      * Each time the data for the created entity is sent to the server, a {@link #event:createSent} event is
      * fired and each time the client receives a response for the creation, a {@link #event:createCompleted}
      * event is fired, independent of whether the creation was successful or not.
      *
      * The initial data for the created entity can be supplied via the parameter `oInitialData` and modified
      * via property bindings. Properties that are not part of the initial data show the default value from the
      * service metadata on the UI, but they are not sent to the server. If there is no default value, `null`
      * is used instead, even if the property is not `Nullable`. The initial data may contain instance annotations.
      *
      * Note: If a server requires a property in the request, you must supply this property in the initial data,
      * for example if the server requires a unit for an amount. This also applies if this property has a default
      * value.
      *
      * Note: After creation, the created entity is refreshed to ensure that the data specified in this list
      * binding's $expand is available. This refresh is done via the group ID of the binding, unless the group
      * ID has {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.SubmitMode.API}, in which case '$auto' is used. To skip this refresh,
      * set `bSkipRefresh` to `true`. To avoid errors you must skip this refresh when using {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#requestSideEffects}
      * in the same $batch to refresh the complete collection containing the newly created entity.
      *
      * Note: A deep create is not supported. The dependent entity has to be created using a second list binding.
      * Note that it is not supported to bind relative to a transient context.
      *
      * Note: Creating at the end is only allowed if the final length of the binding is known (see {@link #isLengthFinal}),
      * so that there is a clear position to place this entity at. This is the case if the complete collection
      * has been read or if the system query option `$count` is `true` and the binding has processed at least
      * one request.
