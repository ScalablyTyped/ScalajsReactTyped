  /**
    * Constructs and initializes a managed object with the given `sId` and settings.
    *
    * If the optional `mSettings` are given, they must be a simple object that defines values for properties,
    * aggregations, associations or events keyed by their name.
    *
    * **Valid Names and Value Ranges:**
    *
    * The property (key) names supported in the object literal are exactly the (case sensitive) names documented
    * in the JSDoc for the properties, aggregations, associations and events of the current class and its base
    * classes. Note that for 0..n aggregations and associations this name usually is the plural name, whereas
    * it is the singular name in case of 0..1 relations.
    *
    * The possible values for a setting depend on its kind:
    * 	 - for simple properties, the value has to match the documented type of the property (no type conversion
    * 			occurs)
    * 	 - for 0..1 aggregations, the value has to be an instance of the aggregated type
    * 	 - for 0..n aggregations, the value has to be an array of instances of the aggregated type or a single
    * 			instance
    * 	 - for 0..1 associations, an instance of the associated type or an id (string) is accepted
    * 	 - for 0..n associations, an array of instances of the associated type or of IDs is accepted
    * 	 - for events, either a function (event handler) is accepted or an array of length 2 where the first
    * 			element is a function and the 2nd element is an object to invoke the method on; or an array of length
    * 			3, where the first element is an arbitrary payload object, the second one is a function and the 3rd one
    * 			is an object to invoke the method on; or an array of arrays where each nested array has the 2 or 3 element
    * 			structure described before (multiple listeners).
    *
    * Each subclass should document the name and type of its supported settings in its constructor documentation.
    *
    * Example usage:
    * ```javascript
    *
    * new Dialog({
    *    title: "Some title text",            // property of type "string"
    *    showHeader: true,                    // property of type "boolean"
    *    endButton: new Button(...),          // 0..1 aggregation
    *    content: [                           // 0..n aggregation
    *       new Input(...),
    *       new Input(...)
    *    ],
    *    afterClose: function(oEvent) { ... } // event handler function
    * });
    * ```
    *
    *
    * Instead of static values and object instances, data binding expressions can be used, either embedded
    * in a string or as a binding info object as described in {@link #bindProperty} or {@link #bindAggregation}.
    *
    * Example usage:
    * ```javascript
    *
    * new Dialog({
    *    title: "{/title}",       // embedded binding expression, points to a string property in the data model
    *    ...
    *    content: {               // binding info object
    *       path : "/inputItems", // points to a collection in the data model
    *       template : new Input(...)
    *    }
    * });
    * ```
    *
    *
    * Note that when setting string values, any curly braces in those values need to be escaped, so they are
    * not interpreted as binding expressions. Use {@link #escapeSettingsValue} to do so.
    *
    * Besides the settings documented below, ManagedObject itself supports the following special settings:
    *
    * 	 - `id : sap.ui.core.ID` an ID for the new instance. Some subclasses (Element, Component) require
    * 			the id to be unique in a specific scope (e.g. an Element Id must be unique across all Elements, a Component
    * 			id must be unique across all Components). `models : object` a map of {@link sap.ui.model.Model}
    * 			instances keyed by their model name (alias). Each entry with key k in this object has the same
    * 			effect as a call `this.setModel(models[k], k);`.
    * 	 - `bindingContexts : object` a map of {@link sap.ui.model.Context} instances keyed by their
    * 			model name. Each entry with key k in this object has the same effect as a call `this.setBindingContext(bindingContexts[k],
    * 			k);`
    * 	 - `objectBindings : object` a map of binding paths keyed by the corresponding model name. Each
    * 			entry with key k in this object has the same effect as a call `this.bindObject(objectBindings[k],
    * 			k);` `metadataContexts : object` an array of single binding contexts keyed by the corresponding
    * 			model or context name. The purpose of the `metadataContexts` special setting is to deduce as much information
    * 			as possible from the binding context of the control in order to be able to predefine certain standard
    * 			properties like e.g. visible, enabled, tooltip,...
    *
    * The structure is an array of single contexts, where a single context is a map containing the following
    * keys:
    * 	 - `path: string (mandatory)` The path to the corresponding model property or object, e.g. '/Customers/Name'.
    * 			A path can also be relative, e.g. 'Name'
    * 	 - `model: string (optional)` The name of the model, in case there is no name then the undefined
    * 			model is taken
    * 	 - `name: string (optional)` A name for the context to used in templating phase
    * 	 - `kind: string (optional)` The kind of the adapter, either `field` for single properties or
    * 			`object` for structured contexts. `adapter: string (optional)` The path to an interpretion
    * 			class that dilivers control relevant data depending on the context, e.g. enabled, visible. If not supplied
    * 			the OData meta data is interpreted.  The syntax for providing the `metadataContexts` is as follows:
    * 			`{SINGLE_CONTEXT1},...,{SINGLE_CONTEXTn}` or for simplicity in case there is only one context `{SINGLE_CONTEXT}`.
    *
    * Examples for such metadataContexts are:
    * 	 - `{/Customers/Name}` a single part with an absolute path to the property Name of the Customers
    * 			entity set in the default model
    * 	 - `{path: 'Customers/Name', model:'json'}` a single part with an absolute path to the property Name
    * 			of the Customers entity set in a named model
    * 	 - `{parts: [{path: 'Customers/Name'},{path: 'editable', model: 'viewModel'}]}` a combination of single
    * 			binding contexts, one context from the default model and one from the viewModel

      * ```
      *
      *
      * Detailed explanation of properties
      *
      *
      * **'library'** : string
      *  Name of the library that the new subclass should belong to. If the subclass is a control or element,
      * it will automatically register with that library so that authoring tools can discover it. By convention,
      * the name of the subclass should have the library name as a prefix, but subfolders are allowed, e.g. `sap.ui.layout.form.Form`
      * belongs to library `sap.ui.layout`.
      *
      * **'properties'** : object
      *  An object literal whose properties each define a new managed property in the ManagedObject subclass.
      * The value can either be a simple string which then will be assumed to be the type of the new property
      * or it can be an object literal with the following properties
      * 	 - `type: string` type of the new property. Must either be one of the built-in types 'string',
      * 			'boolean', 'int', 'float', 'object', 'function' or 'any', or a type created and registered with {@link
      * 			sap.ui.base.DataType.createType} or an array type based on one of the previous types (e.g. 'int[]' or
      * 			'string[]', but not just 'array').
      * 	 - `visibility: string` either 'hidden' or 'public', defaults to 'public'. Properties that belong
      * 			to the API of a class must be 'public' whereas 'hidden' properties can only be used internally. Only
      * 			public properties are accepted by the constructor or by `applySettings` or in declarative representations
      * 			like an `XMLView`. Equally, only public properties are cloned.
      * 	 - `byValue: boolean` (either can be omitted or set to the boolean value `true`) If set to `true`,
      * 			the property value will be {@link module:sap/base/util/deepClone deep cloned} on write and read operations
      * 			to ensure that the internal value can't be modified by the outside. The property `byValue` is currently
      * 			restricted to a `boolean` value. Other types are reserved for future use. Class definitions must only
      * 			use boolean values for the flag (or omit it), but readers of ManagedObject metadata should handle any
      * 			truthy value as `true` to be future safe. Note that using `byValue:true` has a performance impact on
      * 			property access and therefore should be used carefully. It also doesn't make sense to set this option
      * 			for properties with a primitive type (they have value semantic anyhow) or for properties with arrays
      * 			of primitive types (they are already cloned with a less expensive implementation). `group:string`
      * 			a semantic grouping of the properties, intended to be used in design time tools. Allowed values are (case
      * 			sensitive): Accessibility, Appearance, Behavior, Data, Designtime, Dimension, Identification, Misc
      * 	 - `defaultValue: any` the default value for the property or null if there is no defaultValue.
      *
      * 	 - `bindable: boolean|string` (either can be omitted or set to the boolean value `true` or the
      * 			magic string 'bindable') If set to `true` or 'bindable', additional named methods `bindName` and
      * 			`unbindName` are generated as convenience. Despite its name, setting this flag is not mandatory
      * 			to make the managed property bindable. The generic methods {@link #bindProperty} and {@link #unbindProperty}
      * 			can always be used.  `selector: string` Optional; can be set to a valid CSS selector (as accepted
      * 			by the {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelector Element.prototype.querySelector}
      * 			method). When set, it locates the DOM element that represents this property's value. It should only be
      * 			set for properties that have a visual text representation in the DOM.
      *
      * The purpose of the selector is to allow other framework parts or design time tooling to identify the
      * DOM parts of a control or element that represent a specific property without knowing the control or element
      * implementation in detail.
      *
      * As an extension to the standard CSS selector syntax, the selector string can contain the placeholder
      * `{id}` (multiple times). Before evaluating the selector in the context of an element or control, all
      * occurrences of the placeholder have to be replaced by the (potentially escaped) ID of that element or
      * control. In fact, any selector should start with `#{id}` to ensure that the query result is limited to
      * the desired element or control.
      *
      * **Note**: there is a convenience method {@link sap.ui.core.Element#getDomRefForSetting} that evaluates
      * the selector in the context of a concrete element or control instance. It also handles the placeholder
      * `{id}`. Only selected framework features may use that private method, it is not yet a public API and
      * might be changed or removed in future versions of UI5. However, instead of maintaining the `selector`
      * in the metadata, element and control classes can overwrite `getDomRefForSetting` and determine the DOM
      * element dynamically.  Property names should use camelCase notation, start with a lowercase
      * letter and only use characters from the set [a-zA-Z0-9_$]. If an aggregation in the literal is preceded
      * by a JSDoc comment (doclet) and if the UI5 plugin and template are used for JSDoc3 generation, the doclet
      * will be used as generic documentation of the aggregation.
      *
      * For each public property 'foo', the following methods will be created by the "extend" method and will
      * be added to the prototype of the subclass:
      * 	 - getFoo() - returns the current value of property 'foo'. Internally calls {@link #getProperty}
      * 	 - setFoo(v) - sets 'v' as the new value of property 'foo'. Internally calls {@link #setProperty}
      * 	 - bindFoo(c) - (only if property was defined to be 'bindable'): convenience function that wraps {@link
      * 			#bindProperty}
      * 	 - unbindFoo() - (only if property was defined to be 'bindable'): convenience function that wraps {@link
      * 			#unbindProperty}  For hidden properties, no methods are generated.
      *
      * **'defaultProperty'** : string
      *  When specified, the default property must match the name of one of the properties defined for the new
      * subclass (either own or inherited). The named property can be used to identify the main property to be
      * used for bound data. E.g. the value property of a field control.
      *
      * **'aggregations'** : object
      *  An object literal whose properties each define a new aggregation in the ManagedObject subclass. The
      * value can either be a simple string which then will be assumed to be the type of the new aggregation
      * or it can be an object literal with the following properties
      * 	 - `type: string` type of the new aggregation. must be the full global name of a ManagedObject
      * 			subclass or UI5 interface (in dot notation, e.g. 'sap.m.Button')
      * 	 - `[multiple]: boolean` whether the aggregation is a 0..1 (false) or a 0..n aggregation (true),
      * 			defaults to true
      * 	 - `[singularName]: string`. Singular name for 0..n aggregations. For 0..n aggregations the name
      * 			by convention should be the plural name. Methods affecting multiple objects in an aggregation will use
      * 			the plural name (e.g. getItems(), whereas methods that deal with a single object will use the singular
      * 			name (e.g. addItem). The framework knows a set of common rules for building plural form of English nouns
      * 			and uses these rules to determine a singular name on its own. if that name is wrong, a singluarName can
      * 			be specified with this property.
      * 	 - `[visibility]: string` either 'hidden' or 'public', defaults to 'public'. Aggregations that
      * 			belong to the API of a class must be 'public' whereas 'hidden' aggregations typically are used for the
      * 			implementation of composite classes (e.g. composite controls). Only public aggregations are accepted
      * 			by the constructor or by `applySettings` or in declarative representations like an `XMLView`. Equally,
      * 			only public aggregations are cloned.
      * 	 - `bindable: boolean|string` (either can be omitted or set to the boolean value `true` or the
      * 			magic string 'bindable') If set to `true` or 'bindable', additional named methods `bindName` and
      * 			`unbindName` are generated as convenience. Despite its name, setting this flag is not mandatory
      * 			to make the managed aggregation bindable. The generic methods {@link #bindAggregation} and {@link #unbindAggregation}
      * 			can always be used.
      * 	 - `forwarding: object` If set, this defines a forwarding of objects added to this aggregation
      * 			into an aggregation of another ManagedObject - typically to an inner control within a composite control.
      * 			This means that all adding, removal, or other operations happening on the source aggregation are actually
      * 			called on the target instance. All elements added to the source aggregation will be located at the target
      * 			aggregation (this means the target instance is their parent). Both, source and target element will return
      * 			the added elements when asked for the content of the respective aggregation. If present, the named (non-generic)
      * 			aggregation methods will be called for the target aggregation. Aggregations can only be forwarded to
      * 			non-hidden aggregations of the same or higher multiplicity (i.e. an aggregation with multiplicity "0..n"
      * 			cannot be forwarded to an aggregation with multiplicity "0..1"). The target aggregation must also be
      * 			"compatible" to the source aggregation in the sense that any items given to the source aggregation must
      * 			also be valid in the target aggregation (otherwise the target element will throw a validation error).
      * 			If the forwarded elements use data binding, the target element must be properly aggregated by the source
      * 			element to make sure all models are available there as well. The aggregation target must remain the same
      * 			instance across the entire lifetime of the source control. Aggregation forwarding will behave unexpectedly
      * 			when the content in the target aggregation is modified by other actors (e.g. by the target element or
      * 			by another forwarding from a different source aggregation). Hence, this is not allowed. The forwarding
      * 			configuration object defines the target of the forwarding. The available settings are:
      * 	`idSuffix: string`A string which is appended to the ID of this ManagedObject to construct
      * the ID of the target ManagedObject. This is one of the two options to specify the target. This option
      * requires the target instance to be created in the init() method of this ManagedObject and to be always
      * available.
      * 	 - `getter: string`The name of the function on instances of this ManagedObject which returns
      * 			the target instance. This second option to specify the target can be used for lazy instantiation of the
      * 			target. Note that either idSuffix or getter must be given. Also note that the target instance returned
      * 			by the getter must remain the same over the entire lifetime of this ManagedObject and the implementation
      * 			assumes that all instances return the same type of object (at least the target aggregation must always
      * 			be defined in the same class).
      * 	 - `aggregation: string`The name of the aggregation on the target into which the objects shall
      * 			be forwarded. The multiplicity of the target aggregation must be the same as the one of the source aggregation
      * 			for which forwarding is defined.
      * 	 - `[forwardBinding]: boolean`Whether any binding should happen on the forwarding target or not.
      * 			Default if omitted is `false`, which means any bindings happen on the outer ManagedObject. When the binding
      * 			is forwarded, all binding methods like updateAggregation, getBindingInfo, refreshAggregation etc. are
      * 			called on the target element of the forwarding instead of being called on this element. The basic aggregation
      * 			mutator methods (add/remove etc.) are only called on the forwarding target element. Without forwardBinding,
      * 			they are called on this element, but forwarded to the forwarding target, where they actually modify the
      * 			aggregation.    `selector: string` Optional; can be set to a valid CSS selector
      * 			(as accepted by the {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelector Element.prototype.querySelector}
      * 			method). When set, it locates the DOM element that surrounds the aggregation's content. It should only
      * 			be set for aggregations that have a visual representation in the DOM. A DOM element surrounding the aggregation's
      * 			rendered content should be available in the DOM, even if the aggregation is empty or not rendered for
      * 			some reason. In cases where this is not possible or not intended, `getDomRefForSetting` can be overridden,
      * 			see below.
      *
      * The purpose of the selector is to allow other framework parts like drag and drop or design time tooling
      * to identify those DOM parts of a control or element that represent a specific aggregation without knowing
      * the control or element implementation in detail.
      *
      * As an extension to the standard CSS selector syntax, the selector string can contain the placeholder
      * `{id}` (multiple times). Before evaluating the selector in the context of an element or control, all
      * occurrences of the placeholder have to be replaced by the (potentially escaped) ID of that element or
      * control. In fact, any selector should start with `#{id}` to ensure that the query result is limited to
      * the desired element or control.
      *
      * **Note**: there is a convenience method {@link sap.ui.core.Element#getDomRefForSetting} that evaluates
      * the selector in the context of a concrete element or control instance. It also handles the placeholder
      * `{id}`. Only selected framework features may use that private method, it is not yet a public API and
      * might be changed or removed in future versions of UI5. However, instead of maintaining the `selector`
      * in the metadata, element and control classes can overwrite `getDomRefForSetting` to calculate or add
      * the appropriate DOM Element dynamically.   Aggregation names should use camelCase notation,
      * start with a lowercase letter and only use characters from the set [a-zA-Z0-9_$]. The name for a hidden
      * aggregations might start with an underscore. If an aggregation in the literal is preceded by a JSDoc
      * comment (doclet) and if the UI5 plugin and template are used for JSDoc3 generation, the doclet will be
      * used as generic documentation of the aggregation.
      *
      * For each public aggregation 'item' of cardinality 0..1, the following methods will be created by the
      * "extend" method and will be added to the prototype of the subclass:
      * 	 - getItem() - returns the current value of aggregation 'item'. Internally calls {@link #getAggregation}
      * 			with a default value of `undefined`
      * 	 - setItem(o) - sets 'o' as the new aggregated object in aggregation 'item'. Internally calls {@link
      * 			#setAggregation}
      * 	 - destroyItem(o) - destroy a currently aggregated object in aggregation 'item' and clears the aggregation.
      * 			Internally calls {@link #destroyAggregation}
      * 	 - bindItem(c) - (only if aggregation was defined to be 'bindable'): convenience function that wraps
      * 			{@link #bindAggregation}
      * 	 - unbindItem() - (only if aggregation was defined to be 'bindable'): convenience function that wraps
      * 			{@link #unbindAggregation}  For a public aggregation 'items' of cardinality 0..n, the following
      * 			methods will be created:
      * 	 - getItems() - returns an array with the objects contained in aggregation 'items'. Internally calls
      * 			{@link #getAggregation} with a default value of `[]`
      * 	 - addItem(o) - adds an object as last element in the aggregation 'items'. Internally calls {@link #addAggregation}
      *
      * 	 - insertItem(o,p) - inserts an object into the aggregation 'items'. Internally calls {@link #insertAggregation}
      *
      * 	 - indexOfItem(o) - returns the position of the given object within the aggregation 'items'. Internally
      * 			calls {@link #indexOfAggregation}
      * 	 - removeItem(v) - removes an object from the aggregation 'items'. Internally calls {@link #removeAggregation}
      *
      * 	 - removeItems() - removes all objects from the aggregation 'items'. Internally calls {@link #removeAllAggregation}
      *
      * 	 - destroyItems() - destroy all currently aggregated objects in aggregation 'items' and clears the aggregation.
      * 			Internally calls {@link #destroyAggregation}
      * 	 - bindItems(c) - (only if aggregation was defined to be 'bindable'): convenience function that wraps
      * 			{@link #bindAggregation}
      * 	 - unbindItems() - (only if aggregation was defined to be 'bindable'): convenience function that wraps
      * 			{@link #unbindAggregation}  For hidden aggregations, no methods are generated.
      *
      * **'defaultAggregation'** : string
      *  When specified, the default aggregation must match the name of one of the aggregations defined for the
      * new subclass (either own or inherited). The named aggregation will be used in contexts where no aggregation
      * is specified. E,g. when an object in an XMLView embeds other objects without naming an aggregation, as
      * in the following example:
      * ```javascript
      *
      *  <!-- assuming the defaultAggregation for Dialog is 'content' -->
      *  <Dialog>
      *    <Text/>
      *    <Button/>
      *  </Dialog>
      * ```
      *
      *
      * **'associations'** : object
      *  An object literal whose properties each define a new association of the ManagedObject subclass. The
      * value can either be a simple string which then will be assumed to be the type of the new association
      * or it can be an object literal with the following properties
      * 	 - `type: string` type of the new association
      * 	 - `multiple: boolean` whether the association is a 0..1 (false) or a 0..n association (true),
      * 			defaults to false(1) for associations
      * 	 - `[singularName]: string`. Singular name for 0..n associations. For 0..n associations the name
      * 			by convention should be the plural name. Methods affecting multiple objects in an association will use
      * 			the plural name (e.g. getItems(), whereas methods that deal with a single object will use the singular
      * 			name (e.g. addItem). The framework knows a set of common rules for building plural form of English nouns
      * 			and uses these rules to determine a singular name on its own. if that name is wrong, a singluarName can
      * 			be specified with this property.
      * 	 - `visibility: string` either 'hidden' or 'public', defaults to 'public'. Associations that
      * 			belong to the API of a class must be 'public' whereas 'hidden' associations can only be used internally.
      * 			Only public associations are accepted by the constructor or by `applySettings` or in declarative representations
      * 			like an `XMLView`. Equally, only public associations are cloned.  Association names should use camelCase
      * 			notation, start with a lowercase letter and only use characters from the set [a-zA-Z0-9_$]. If an association
      * 			in the literal is preceded by a JSDoc comment (doclet) and if the UI5 plugin and template are used for
      * 			JSDoc3 generation, the doclet will be used as generic documentation of the association.
      *
      * For each association 'ref' of cardinality 0..1, the following methods will be created by the "extend"
      * method and will be added to the prototype of the subclass:
      * 	 - getRef() - returns the current value of association 'item'. Internally calls {@link #getAssociation}
      * 			with a default value of `undefined`
      * 	 - setRef(o) - sets 'o' as the new associated object in association 'item'. Internally calls {@link
      * 			#setAssociation}  For a public association 'refs' of cardinality 0..n, the following methods will
      * 			be created:
      * 	 - getRefs() - returns an array with the objects contained in association 'items'. Internally calls
      * 			{@link #getAssociation} with a default value of `[]`
      * 	 - addRef(o) - adds an object as last element in the association 'items'. Internally calls {@link #addAssociation}
      *
      * 	 - removeRef(v) - removes an object from the association 'items'. Internally calls {@link #removeAssociation}
      *
      * 	 - removeAllRefs() - removes all objects from the association 'items'. Internally calls {@link #removeAllAssociation}
      * 			 For hidden associations, no methods are generated.
      *
      * **'events'** : object
      *  An object literal whose properties each define a new event of the ManagedObject subclass. The value
      * can either be a simple string which then will be assumed to be the type of the new association or it
      * can be an object literal with the following properties
      * 	 - `allowPreventDefault: boolean` whether the event allows to prevented the default behavior
      * 			of the event source
      * 	 - `parameters: object` an object literal that describes the parameters of this event.
      * 			Event names should use camelCase notation, start with a lower-case letter and only use characters from
      * 			the set [a-zA-Z0-9_$]. If an event in the literal is preceded by a JSDoc comment (doclet) and if the
      * 			UI5 plugin and template are used for JSDoc3 generation, the doclet will be used as generic documentation
      * 			of the event.
      *
      * For each event 'Some' the following methods will be created by the "extend" method and will be added
      * to the prototype of the subclass:
      * 	 - attachSome(fn,o) - registers a listener for the event. Internally calls {@link #attachEvent}
      * 	 - detachSome(fn,o) - deregisters a listener for the event. Internally calls {@link #detachEvent}
      * 	 - fireSome() - fire the event. Internally calls {@link #fireEvent}
      *
      * **'specialSettings'** : object
      *  Special settings are an experimental feature and MUST NOT BE DEFINED in controls or applications outside
      * of the `sap.ui.core` library. There's no generic or general way how to set or get the values for special
      * settings. For the same reason, they cannot be bound against a model. If there's a way for consumers to
      * define a value for a special setting, it must be documented in the class that introduces the setting.

      * Binds a property to the model.
      *
      * Whenever the corresponding model becomes available or changes (either via a call to {@link #setModel
      * setModel} or propagated from a {@link #getParent parent}), its {@link sap.ui.model.Model#bindProperty
      * bindProperty} method will be called to create a new {@link sap.ui.model.PropertyBinding PropertyBinding}
      * with the configured binding options.
      *
      * The Setter for the given property will be called by the binding with the value retrieved from the data
      * model. When the binding mode is `OneTime`, the property will be set only once. When it is `OneWay`, the
      * property will be updated whenever the corresponding data in the model changes. In mode `TwoWay`, changes
      * to the property (not originating in the model) will be reported back to the model (typical use case:
      * user interaction changes the value of a control).
      *
      * This is a generic method which can be used to bind any property to the model. A managed object may flag
      * any property in its metadata with `bindable: "bindable"` to additionally provide named methods to bind
      * and unbind the corresponding property.
      *
      * **Composite Binding**
      *  A composite property binding which combines data from multiple model paths can be declared using the
      * `parts` parameter instead of `path`. The `formatter` function or a {@link sap.ui.model.CompositeType
      * composite type} then can be used to combine the parts, Properties with a composite binding are also known
      * as "calculated fields".
      *
      * Example:
      * ```javascript
      *
      *   oTxt.bindValue({
      *     parts: [
      *       {path: "/firstName", type: "sap.ui.model.type.String"},
      *       {path: "myModel2>/lastName"}
      *     ]
      *   });
      * ```
      *
      *
      * Note that a composite binding will be forced into mode `OneWay` when one of the binding parts is not
      * in mode `TwoWay`.
      *
      * **Static Binding**
      *  A StaticBinding allows to define static values within a `sap.ui.model.CompositeBinding`. It behaves
      * like a property binding but always returns the value that is stored in the binding itself. The binding
      * does not have a `sap.ui.model.Context`, a `sap.ui.model.Model` or a `oBindingInfo.path`. A StaticBinding
      * is created when a `oBindingInfo.value` is passed instead of a `oBindingInfo.path` or `oBindingInfo.parts[i].path`.
      *
      * Also see {@link sap.ui.model.StaticBinding StaticBinding} in the documentation.
      *
      * **Formatter Functions**
      *  When a formatter function is specified for the binding or for a binding part, it will be called with
      * the value of the bound model property. After setting the initial property value, the formatter function
      * will only be called again when the bound model property changes (simple property binding) or when at
      * least one of the bound model properties changes (formatter function of a composite binding). Note that
      * a binding only monitors the bound model data for changes. Dependencies of the formatter implementation
      * to other model data is not known to the binding and changes won't be detected.
      *
      * When the formatter for a property binding (simple or composite) is called, the managed object will be
      * given as `this` context. For formatters of binding parts in a composite binding, this is not the case.
      *
      * Also see {@link topic:91f0652b6f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070 Property Binding} in the documentation.
      *

      * etc. It might differ from the object on which the application originally added this object (the so called
      * 'API parent'): some composite controls internally use hidden controls or containers to store their children.
      * This method will return the innermost container that technically contains this object as a child.
      *
      * **Example:**
      *
      * Assume that a `Dialog` internally uses a (hidden) `VerticalLayout` to store its content:
      *
      *
      * ```javascript
      *
      *   Dialog (API parent)
      *    \__ VerticalLayout (hidden composite part)
      *       \__ Text (API child)
      * ```
      *
      *
      * If you add some content by calling the `Dialog.prototype.addContent` API, this will lead to the following
      * observations:
      *
      *
      * ```javascript
      *
      *   oDialog.addContent(oText);
      *   console.log(oText.getParent() === oDialog);  // false
      *   console.log(oText.getParent() instanceof VerticalLayout); // true
      *   console.log(oText.getParent().getParent() === oDialog); // true now, but might fail with later versions
      * ```
      *
      *
      * Technically, from API perspective, `oText` is added as a child to `Dialog`. But internally, the `Dialog`
      * adds the child to the hidden `VerticalLayout` container. If you now call the `getParent` method of the
      * child, you will get the internal `VerticalLayout` object and not the `Dialog` API parent.
      *
      * **Note: ** The internal (hidden) structure of a composite control is not fixed and may be changed (see
      * also our "Compatibility Rules"). Therefore, you should **never** rely on a specific structure or object
      * being returned by `getParent`.
