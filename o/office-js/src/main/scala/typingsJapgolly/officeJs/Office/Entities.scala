/**
  * Represents a collection of entities found in an email message or appointment. Read mode only.
  *
  * The `Entities` object is a container for the entity arrays returned by the `getEntities` and `getEntitiesByType` methods when the item 
  * (either an email message or an appointment) contains one or more entities that have been found by the server. 
  * You can use these entities in your code to provide additional context information to the viewer, such as a map to an address found in the item, 
  * or to open a dialer for a phone number found in the item.
  *
  * If no entities of the type specified in the property are present in the item, the property associated with that entity is null. 
  * For example, if a message contains a street address and a phone number, the addresses property and phoneNumbers property would contain 
  * information, and the other properties would be null.
  *
  * To be recognized as an address, the string must contain a United States postal address that has at least a subset of the elements of a street 
  * number, street name, city, state, and zip code.
  *
  * To be recognized as a phone number, the string must contain a North American phone number format.
  *
  * Entity recognition relies on natural language recognition that is based on machine learning of large amounts of data. 
  * The recognition of an entity is non-deterministic and success sometimes relies on the particular context in the item.
  *
  * When the property arrays are returned by the `getEntitiesByType` method, only the property for the specified entity contains data; 
  * all other properties are null.
