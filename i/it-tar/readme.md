# Scala.js typings for it-tar

Typings are for version 6.0.0

## Library description:
it-tar is a streaming tar parser (and maybe a generator in the future) and nothing else. It operates purely using async iterables which means you can easily extract/parse tarballs without ever hitting the file system.
