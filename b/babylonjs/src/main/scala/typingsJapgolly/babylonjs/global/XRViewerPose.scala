/**
  * An XRPose describing the state of a viewer of the XR scene as tracked by the XR
  * device. A viewer may represent a tracked piece of hardware, the observed position
  * of a user's head relative to the hardware, or some other means of computing a series
  * of viewpoints into the XR scene. XRViewerPoses can only be queried relative to an
  * XRReferenceSpace. It provides, in addition to the XRPose values, an array of views
  * which include rigid transforms to indicate the viewpoint and projection matrices.
  * These values should be used by the application when rendering a frame of an XR scene.
