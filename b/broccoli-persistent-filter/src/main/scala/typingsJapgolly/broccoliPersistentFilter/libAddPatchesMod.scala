    * Create a new patch that achieves the same outcome as if the patches from
    * list 1 were applied and then the patches from list2 were applied. In some
    * cases this means we can efficiently skip doing some work in one or both of
    * the lists.
    *
    * It is assumed that neither list contains more than one operation per file.
    *
    * If both lists patch the same file, the following resolution table is used:
    * * `3` - both patches are kept.
    * * `2` - the patch from list 2 is kept.
    * * `1` - the patch from list 1 is kept.
    * * `0` - both entries are dropped.
    * * `-` - not applicable
    * * `?` - this is weird maybe it should be an error
    *
    * TODO: This should probably live in `fs-tree-diff`.
