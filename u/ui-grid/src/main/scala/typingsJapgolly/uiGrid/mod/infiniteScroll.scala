      * Call this function when you have loaded the additional data requested.
      * You should set scrollUp and scrollDown to indicate whether there are still more pages in each direction.
      *
      * If you call dataLoaded without first calling saveScrollPercentage, then we will scroll the user to the
      * start of the newly loaded data.  This usually makes scrolling smooth, but be jumpy with large
      * infiniteScrollRowsFromEnd values, and on variable speed internet connections.
      * Using saveScrollPercentage as demonstrated in the tutorial should give a smoother scrolling experience
      * for users.
      *
      * See infinite_scroll tutorial for example of usage
      * @param scrollUp if set to false flags that there are no more pages upwards, so don't fire any
      *        more infinite scroll events upward
      * @param scrollDown if set to false flags that there are no more pages downwards, so don't fire
      *        any more infinite scroll events downward
      * @returns a promise that is resolved when the grid scrolling is fully adjusted.
      *          If you're planning to remove pages, you should wait on this promise first, or you'll break the
      *          scroll positioning
