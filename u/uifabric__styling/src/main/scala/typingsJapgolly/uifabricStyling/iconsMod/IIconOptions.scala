    *
    * Icon set was previously registered using a different base url.
    * Icon set was previously registered but a different version was provided.
    * Icons in a previous registered set overlap with a new set.
    *
    * To simply ignore previously registered icons, you can specify to disable warnings. This means
    * that if an icon which was previous registered is registered again, it will be silently ignored.
