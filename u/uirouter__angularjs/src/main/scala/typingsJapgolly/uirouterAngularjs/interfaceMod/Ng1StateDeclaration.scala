  /**
    * An optional object which defines multiple named views.
    *
    * Each key is the name of a view, and each value is a [[Ng1ViewDeclaration]].
    * Unnamed views are internally renamed to `$default`.
    *
    * A view's name is used to match an active `<ui-view>` directive in the DOM.  When the state
    * is entered, the state's views are activated and matched with active `<ui-view>` directives:
    *
    * - The view's name is processed into a ui-view target:
    *   - ui-view address: an address to a ui-view
    *   - state anchor: the state to anchor the address to
    *
    *  Examples:
    *
    *  Targets three named ui-views in the parent state's template
    *
    * #### Example:
    * ```js
    * views: {
    *   header: {
    *     controller: "headerCtrl",
    *     templateUrl: "header.html"
    *   },
    *   body: {
    *     controller: "bodyCtrl",
    *     templateUrl: "body.html"
    *   },
    *   footer: "footerComponent"
    * }
    * ```
    *
    * #### Example:
    * ```js
    * // Targets named ui-view="header" in the template of the ancestor state 'top'
    * // and the named `ui-view="body" from the parent state's template.
    * views: {
    *   'header@top': {
    *     controller: "msgHeaderCtrl",
    *     templateUrl: "msgHeader.html"
    *   },
    *   'body': {
    *     controller: "messagesCtrl",
    *     templateUrl: "messages.html"
    *   }
    * }
    * ```
    *
    * ## View targeting details
    *
    * There are a few styles of view addressing/targeting.
    * The most common is a simple `ui-view` name
    *
    * #### Simple ui-view name
    *
    * Addresses without an `@` are anchored to the parent state.
    *
    * #### Example:
    * ```js
    * // target the `<div ui-view='foo'></div>` created in the parent state's view
    * views: {
    *   foo: {...}
    * }
    * ```
    *
    * #### View name anchored to a state
    *
    * You can anchor the `ui-view` name to a specific state by including an `@`
    *
    * #### Example:
    * targets the `<div ui-view='foo'></div>` which was created in a view owned by the state `bar.baz`
    * ```js
    * views: {
    *   'foo@bar.baz': {...}
    * }
    * ```
    *
    * #### Absolute addressing
    *
    * You can address a `ui-view` absolutely, using dotted notation, by prefixing the address with a `!`.
    * Dotted addresses traverse the hierarchy of `ui-view`s active in the DOM:
    *
    * #### Example:
    * absolutely targets the `<div ui-view='nested'></div>`
    * ... which was created in the unnamed/$default root `<ui-view></ui-view>`
    * ```js
    * views: {
    *   '!$default.nested': {...}
    * }
    * ```
    *
    * #### Relative addressing
    *
    * Absolute addressing is actually relative addressing, anchored to the unnamed root state (`""`).
    * You can also use relative addressing anchored to *any state*, in order to target a target deeply nested `ui-views`:
    * The `ui-view` is targeted relative to the anchored state by traversing the nested `ui-view` names.
    *
    * #### Example:
    * targets the `<div ui-view='bar'></div>`
    * ... which was created inside the
    * `<div ui-view='foo'></div>`
    * ... which was created inside the parent state's template.
    * ```js
    * views: {
    *   'foo.bar': {...}
    * }
    * ```
    *
    * #### Example:
    * targets the `<div ui-view='bar'></div>`
    * ... which was created in `<div ui-view='foo'></div>`
    * ... which was created in a template from the state `baz.qux`
    * ```js
    * views: {
    *   'foo.bar@baz.qux': {...}
    * }
    * ```
    *
    * #### Example:
    * a view can relatively target a named `ui-view` defined on an ancestor using `^` (meaning "parent")
    * ```js
    * views: {
    *   'foo@^': {...}, // foo@(parent state) (same as simply 'foo')
    *   'bar@^.^': {...}, // bar@(grandparent state)
    *   'baz@^.^.^': {...}, // baz@(great-grandparent state)
    * }
    * ```
    *
    * For additional in-depth details about how `ui-view` addressing works, see the internal api [[ViewService.match]].
    *
    * ---
    *
    * ## State template+controller and `views:` incompatiblity
    *
    * If a state has a `views` object, any state-level view properties ([[Ng1ViewDeclaration]]) are ignored.  Therefore,
    * if _any view_ for a state is declared in the `views` object, then _all of the state's views_ must be defined in
    * the `views` object.  The state declaration must not have any of the following fields:
    * - component
    * - bindings
    * - resolveAs
    * - template
    * - templateUrl
    * - templateProvider
    * - controller
    * - controllerAs
    * - controllerProvider
