    * three cases:
    * - Normal, with one valid offset. For the vast majority of the year, the normal case
    * applies, where there is a single valid offset for the local date-time.
    * - Gap, with zero valid offsets. This is when clocks jump forward typically due to the
    * spring daylight savings change from "winter" to "summer". In a gap there are local
    * date-time values with no valid offset.
    * - Overlap, with two valid offsets. This is when clocks are set back typically due to
    * the autumn daylight savings change from "summer" to "winter". In an overlap there are
    * local date-time values with two valid offsets.
    *
    * Thus, for any given local date-time there can be zero, one or two valid offsets. This
    * method returns the single offset in the Normal case, and in the Gap or Overlap case it
    * returns the offset before the transition.
    *
    * Since, in the case of Gap and Overlap, the offset returned is a "best" value, rather
    * than the "correct" value, it should be treated with care. Applications that care about
    * the correct offset should use a combination of this method, `getValidOffsets` and
    * `getTransition`.
