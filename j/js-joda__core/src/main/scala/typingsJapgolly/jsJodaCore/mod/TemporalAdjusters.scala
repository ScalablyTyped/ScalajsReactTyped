  /**
    * Returns the day-of-week in month adjuster, which returns a new date in the same month with
    * the ordinal day-of-week. This is used for expressions like the 'second Tuesday in March'.
    *
    * The ISO calendar system behaves as follows:
    * - The input 2011-12-15 for (1,TUESDAY) will return 2011-12-06.
    * - The input 2011-12-15 for (2,TUESDAY) will return 2011-12-13.
    * - The input 2011-12-15 for (3,TUESDAY) will return 2011-12-20.
    * - The input 2011-12-15 for (4,TUESDAY) will return 2011-12-27.
    * - The input 2011-12-15 for (5,TUESDAY) will return 2012-01-03.
    * - The input 2011-12-15 for (-1,TUESDAY) will return 2011-12-27 (last in month).
    * - The input 2011-12-15 for (-4,TUESDAY) will return 2011-12-06 (3 weeks before last in month).
    * - The input 2011-12-15 for (-5,TUESDAY) will return 2011-11-29 (4 weeks before last in month).
    * - The input 2011-12-15 for (0,TUESDAY) will return 2011-11-29 (last in previous month).
    *
    * For a positive or zero ordinal, the algorithm is equivalent to finding the first day-of-week
    * that matches within the month and then adding a number of weeks to it. For a negative
    * ordinal, the algorithm is equivalent to finding the last day-of-week that matches within the
    * month and then subtracting a number of weeks to it. The ordinal number of weeks is not
    * validated and is interpreted leniently according to this algorithm. This definition means
    * that an ordinal of zero finds the last matching day-of-week in the previous month.
    *
    * The behavior is suitable for use with most calendar systems. It uses the `DAY_OF_WEEK`
    * and `DAY_OF_MONTH` fields and the `DAYS` unit, and assumes a seven day week.
