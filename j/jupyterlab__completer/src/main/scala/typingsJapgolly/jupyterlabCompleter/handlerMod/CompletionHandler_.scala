    * #### Notes
    * If a sub-class reimplements this method, then that class must either call
    * its super method or it must take responsibility for adding and removing
    * the completer completable class to the editor host node.
    *
    * Despite the fact that the editor widget adds a class whenever there is a
    * primary selection, this method checks independently for two reasons:
    *
    * 1. The editor widget connects to the same signal to add that class, so
    *    there is no guarantee that the class will be added before this method
    *    is invoked so simply checking for the CSS class's existence is not an
    *    option. Secondarily, checking the editor state should be faster than
    *    querying the DOM in either case.
    * 2. Because this method adds a class that indicates whether completer
    *    functionality ought to be enabled, relying on the behavior of the
    *    `jp-mod-has-primary-selection` to filter out any editors that have
    *    a selection means the semantic meaning of `jp-mod-completer-enabled`
    *    is obscured because there may be cases where the enabled class is added
    *    even though the completer is not available.
