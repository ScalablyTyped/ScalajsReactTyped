/**
  * The Jest farm (publicly called "Worker") is a class that allows you to queue
  * methods across multiple child processes, in order to parallelize work. This
  * is done by providing an absolute path to a module that will be loaded on each
  * of the child processes, and bridged to the main process.
  *
  * Bridged methods are specified by using the "exposedMethods" property of the
  * "options" object. This is an array of strings, where each of them corresponds
  * to the exported name in the loaded module.
  *
  * You can also control the amount of workers by using the "numWorkers" property
  * of the "options" object, and the settings passed to fork the process through
  * the "forkOptions" property. The amount of workers defaults to the amount of
  * CPUS minus one.
  *
  * Queueing calls can be done in two ways:
  *   - Standard method: calls will be redirected to the first available worker,
  *     so they will get executed as soon as they can.
  *
  *   - Sticky method: if a "computeWorkerKey" method is provided within the
  *     config, the resulting string of this method will be used as a key.
  *     Every time this key is returned, it is guaranteed that your job will be
  *     processed by the same worker. This is specially useful if your workers
  *     are caching results.
