    * Sorting tests is very important because it has a great impact on the
    * user-perceived responsiveness and speed of the test run.
    *
    * If such information is on cache, tests are sorted based on:
    * -> Has it failed during the last run ?
    * Since it's important to provide the most expected feedback as quickly
    * as possible.
    * -> How long it took to run ?
    * Because running long tests first is an effort to minimize worker idle
    * time at the end of a long test run.
    * And if that information is not available they are sorted based on file size
    * since big test files usually take longer to complete.
    *
    * Note that a possible improvement would be to analyse other information
    * from the file other than its size.
