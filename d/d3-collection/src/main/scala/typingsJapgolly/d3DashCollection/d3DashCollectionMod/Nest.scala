    * Applies the nest operator to the specified array, returning an array of key-values entries.
    * Conceptually, this is similar to applying map.entries to the associative array returned by nest.map,
    * but it applies to every level of the hierarchy rather than just the first (outermost) level.
    * Each entry in the returned array corresponds to a distinct key value returned by the first key function.
    * The entry value depends on the number of registered key functions: if there is an additional key, the value is another nested array of entries;
    * otherwise, the value is the array of elements filtered from the input array that have the given key value.
    *
    * NOTE:
    *
    * Strictly speaking the return type of this method is:
    *
    * (1) NestedArray<Datum, RollupType>, if at least one key function was defined,
    *
    * (2) Datum[], if neither a key nor a rollup function were defined, and
    *
    * (3) RollupType, if no keys, but a rollup function were defined.
    *
    * Since (2) and (3) are edge cases with little to no practical relevance, they have been omitted in favour of ease-of-use.
    *
    * Should you determine that this simplification creates an issue in practice, please file an issue on
    * https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped.
    *
    * The formal, generalized return type under (1) is cumbersome to work with in practice. The recommended approach
    * is to define the type of the variable being assigned the return value using knowledge specific to the use-case at hand.
    * I.e. making use of knowing how many keys are applied, and the nature of any roll-up function will make working with
    * the variable more meaningful, despite the compromise in type-safety.
