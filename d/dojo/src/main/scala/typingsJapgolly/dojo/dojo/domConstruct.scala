    * as well as an optional DOM placement reference.
    *
    * Attributes are set by passing the optional object through dojo.setAttr.
    * See dojo.setAttr for noted caveats and nuances, and API if applicable.
    *
    * Placement is done via dojo.place, assuming the new node to be the action
    * node, passing along the optional reference node and position.
    *
    * @param tag A string of the element to create (eg: "div", "a", "p", "li", "script", "br"),or an existing DOM node to process.
    * @param attrs An object-hash of attributes to set on the newly created node.Can be null, if you don't want to set any attributes/styles.See: dojo.setAttr for a description of available attributes.
    * @param refNode               OptionalOptional reference node. Used by dojo.place to place the newly creatednode somewhere in the dom relative to refNode. Can be a DomNode referenceor String ID of a node.
    * @param pos               OptionalOptional positional reference. Defaults to "last" by way of dojo.place,though can be set to "first","after","before","last", "replace" or "only"to further control the placement of the new node relative to the refNode.'refNode' is required if a 'pos' is specified.
