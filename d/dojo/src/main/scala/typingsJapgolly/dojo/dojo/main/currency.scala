  * localized formatting and parsing routines for currencies
  * extends dojo.number to provide culturally-appropriate formatting of values
  * in various world currencies, including use of a currency symbol.  The currencies are specified
  * by a three-letter international symbol in all uppercase, and support for the currencies is
  * provided by the data in dojo.cldr.  The scripts generating dojo.cldr specify which
  * currency support is included.  A fixed number of decimal places is determined based
  * on the currency type and is not determined by the 'pattern' argument.  The fractional
  * portion is optional, by default, and variable length decimals are not supported.
