  *
  * Base class for objects that provide named properties with optional getter/setter
  * control and the ability to watch for property changes
  *
  * The class also provides the functionality to auto-magically manage getters
  * and setters for object attributes/properties.
  *
  * Getters and Setters should follow the format of _xxxGetter or _xxxSetter where
  * the xxx is a name of the attribute to handle.  So an attribute of "foo"
  * would have a custom getter of _fooGetter and a custom setter of _fooSetter.
