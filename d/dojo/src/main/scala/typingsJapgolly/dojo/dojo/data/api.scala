      * Given a query and set of defined options, such as a start and count of items to return,

      * The format and expectations of stores is that they operate in a generally asynchronous
      * manner, therefore callbacks are always used to return items located by the fetch parameters.
      * A Request object will always be returned and is returned immediately.
      * The basic request is nothing more than the keyword args passed to fetch and
      * an additional function attached, abort().  The returned request object may then be used
      * to cancel a fetch.  All data items returns are passed through the callbacks defined in the
      * fetch parameters and are not present on the 'request' object.
      *
      * This does not mean that custom stores can not add methods and properties to the request object
      * returned, only that the API does not require it.  For more info about the Request API,
      * see dojo/data/api/Request
      *
      * @param keywordArgs The keywordArgs parameter may either be an instance ofconforming to dojo/data/api/Request or may be a simple anonymous objectthat may contain any of the following:{    query: query-object or query-string,    queryOptions: object,    onBegin: Function,    onItem: Function,    onComplete: Function,    onError: Function,    scope: object,    start: int    count: int    sort: array}All implementations should accept keywordArgs objects with any ofthe 9 standard properties: query, onBegin, onItem, onComplete, onErrorscope, sort, start, and count.  Some implementations may accept additionalproperties in the keywordArgs object as valid parameters, such as{includeOutliers:true}.The query parameterThe query may be optional in some data store implementations.The dojo/data/api/Read API does not specify the syntax or semanticsof the query itself -- each different data store implementationmay have its own notion of what a query should look like.However, as of dojo 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1, all the provided datastores in dojo.dataand dojox.data support an object structure query, where the object is a set ofname/value parameters such as { attrFoo: valueBar, attrFoo1: valueBar1}.  Most of thedijit widgets, such as ComboBox assume this to be the case when working with a datastorewhen they dynamically update the query.  Therefore, for maximum compatibility with dijitwidgets the recommended query parameter is a key/value object.  That does not mean that thethe datastore may not take alternative query forms, such as a simple string, a Date, a number,or a mix of such.  Ultimately, The dojo/data/api/Read API is agnostic about what the queryformat.Further note:  In general for query objects that accept strings as attributevalue matches, the store should also support basic filtering capability, such as (match any character) and ? (match single character).  An example query that is a query objectwould be like: { attrFoo: "value"}.  Which generally means match all items where they havean attribute named attrFoo, with a value that starts with 'value'.The queryOptions parameterThe queryOptions parameter is an optional parameter used to specify options that may modifythe query in some fashion, such as doing a case insensitive search, or doing a deep searchwhere all items in a hierarchical representation of data are scanned instead of just the rootitems.  It currently defines two options that all datastores should attempt to honor if possible:{    ignoreCase: boolean, // Whether or not the query should match case sensitively or not.  Default behaviour is false.    deep: boolean   // Whether or not a fetch should do a deep search of items and all child                    // items instead of just root-level items in a datastore.  Default is false.}The onBegin parameter.function(size, request);If an onBegin callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called just once, before the first onItem callback is called.The onBegin callback function will be passed two arguments, thethe total number of items identified and the Request object.  If the total number isunknown, then size will be -1.  Note that size is not necessarily the size of thecollection of items returned from the query, as the request may have specified to return only asubset of the total set of items through the use of the start and count parameters.The onItem parameter.function(item, request);If an onItem callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called as each item in the result is received. The callbackfunction will be passed two arguments: the item itself, and theRequest object.The onComplete parameter.function(items, request);If an onComplete callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called just once, after the last onItem callback is called.Note that if the onItem callback is not present, then onComplete will be passedan array containing all items which matched the query and the request object.If the onItem callback is present, then onComplete is called as:onComplete(null, request).The onError parameter.function(errorData, request);If an onError callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called if there is any sort of error while attempting toexecute the query.The onError callback function will be passed two arguments:an Error object and the Request object.The scope parameter.If a scope object is provided, all of the callback functions (onItem,onComplete, onError, etc) will be invoked in the context of the scopeobject.  In the body of the callback function, the value of the "this"keyword will be the scope object.   If no scope object is provided,the callback functions will be called in the context of dojo.global().For example, onItem.call(scope, item, request) vs.onItem.call(dojo.global(), item, request)The start parameter.If a start parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore toonly start returning items once the start number of items have been located andskipped.  When this parameter is paired with 'count', the store should be ableto page across queries with millions of hits by only returning subsets of thehits for each queryThe count parameter.If a count parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore toonly return up to that many items.  This allows a fetch call that may havemillions of item matches to be paired down to something reasonable.The sort parameter.If a sort parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore tosort the items in some manner before returning the items.  The array is an array ofjavascript objects that must conform to the following format to be applied to thefetching of items:{    attribute: attribute || attribute-name-string,    descending: true|false;   // Optional.  Default is false.}Note that when comparing attributes, if an item contains no value for the attribute(undefined), then it the default ascending sort logic should push it to the bottomof the list.  In the descending order case, it such items should appear at the top of the list.

It takes only oneparameter, the fully loaded item.The onError parameterFunction(error)The onError parameter is the callback to invoke when the item load encountered an error.  It takes only oneparameter, the error objectThe scope parameterIf a scope object is provided, all of the callback functions (onItem,onError, etc) will be invoked in the context of the scope object.In the body of the callback function, the value of the "this"keyword will be the scope object.   If no scope object is provided,the callback functions will be called in the context of dojo.global().For example, onItem.call(scope, item, request) vs.onItem.call(dojo.global(), item, request)

    * This class defines out the semantics of what a 'Request' object looks like
    * when returned from a fetch() method.  In general, a request object is
    * nothing more than the original keywordArgs from fetch with an abort function
    * attached to it to allow users to abort a particular request if they so choose.
    * No other functions are required on a general Request object return.  That does not
    * inhibit other store implementations from adding extensions to it, of course.
    *
    * This is an abstract API that data provider implementations conform to.
    * This file defines methods signatures and intentionally leaves all the
    * methods unimplemented.
