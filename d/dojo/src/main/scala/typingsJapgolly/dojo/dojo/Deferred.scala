  * Permalink: http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.9/dojo/Deferred.html
  *
  * Creates a new deferred. This API is preferred over
  * dojo/_base/Deferred.
  * Creates a new deferred, as an abstraction over (primarily)
  * asynchronous operations. The deferred is the private interface
  * that should not be returned to calling code. That's what the
  * promise is for. See dojo/promise/Promise.
  *
  * @param canceler       OptionalWill be invoked if the deferred is canceled. The cancelerreceives the reason the deferred was canceled as its argument.The deferred is rejected with its return value, or a newdojo/errors/CancelError instance.
