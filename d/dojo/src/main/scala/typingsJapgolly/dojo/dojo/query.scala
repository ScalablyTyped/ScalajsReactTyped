  *
  * This modules provides DOM querying functionality. The module export is a function
  * that can be used to query for DOM nodes by CSS selector and returns a NodeList
  * representing the matching nodes.
  * dojo/query is responsible for loading the appropriate query engine and wrapping
  * its results with a NodeList. You can use dojo/query with a specific selector engine
  * by using it as a plugin. For example, if you installed the sizzle package, you could
  * use it as the selector engine with:
  *
  * require(["dojo/query!sizzle"], function(query){
  *     query("div")...
  * The id after the ! can be a module id of the selector engine or one of the following values:
  *
  * acme: This is the default engine used by Dojo base, and will ensure that the full
  * Acme engine is always loaded.
  * css2: If the browser has a native selector engine, this will be used, otherwise a
  * very minimal lightweight selector engine will be loaded that can do simple CSS2 selectors
  * (by #id, .class, tag, and [name=value] attributes, with standard child or descendant (>)
  * operators) and nothing more.
  * css2.1: If the browser has a native selector engine, this will be used, otherwise the
  * full Acme engine will be loaded.
  * css3: If the browser has a native selector engine with support for CSS3 pseudo
  * selectors (most modern browsers except IE8), this will be used, otherwise the
  * full Acme engine will be loaded.
  * Or the module id of a selector engine can be used to explicitly choose the selector engine
  *
  * For example, if you are using CSS3 pseudo selectors in module, you can specify that
  * you will need support them with:
  *
  * require(["dojo/query!css3"], function(query){
  *     query('#t > h3:nth-child(odd)')...
  * You can also choose the selector engine/load configuration by setting the query-selector:
  * For example:
  *
  * <script data-dojo-config="query-selector:'css3'" src="dojo.js"></script>
  *
  * @param selector A CSS selector to search for.
  * @param context       OptionalAn optional context to limit the searching scope. Only nodes under context will bescanned.
