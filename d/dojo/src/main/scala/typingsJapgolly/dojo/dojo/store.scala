      * the same.
      *
      * Additional methods include forEach, filter and map.

      * functions or objects by name-value on a query object hash
      * The SimpleQueryEngine provides a way of getting a QueryResults through
      * the use of a simple object hash as a filter.  The hash will be used to
      * match properties on data objects with the corresponding value given. In
      * other words, only exact matches will be returned.
      *
      * This function can be used as a template for more complex query engines;
      * for example, an engine can be created that accepts an object hash that
      * contains filtering functions, or a string that gets evaluated, etc.
      *
      * When creating a new dojo.store, simply set the store's queryEngine
      * field as a reference to this function.
      *
      * @param query An object hash with fields that may match fields of items in the store.Values in the hash will be compared by normal == operator, but regular expressionsor any object that provides a test() method are also supported and can beused to match strings by more complex expressions(and then the regex's or object's test() method will be used to match values).
