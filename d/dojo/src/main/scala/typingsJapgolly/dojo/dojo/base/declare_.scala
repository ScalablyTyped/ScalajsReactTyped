  *
  * Create a feature-rich constructor from compact notation.
  * Create a constructor using a compact notation for inheritance and
  * prototype extension.
  *
  * Mixin ancestors provide a type of multiple inheritance.
  * Prototypes of mixin ancestors are copied to the new class:
  * changes to mixin prototypes will not affect classes to which
  * they have been mixed in.
  *
  * Ancestors can be compound classes created by this version of
  * declare(). In complex cases all base classes are going to be
  * linearized according to C3 MRO algorithm
  * (see http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/ for more
  * details).
  *
  * "className" is cached in "declaredClass" property of the new class,
  * if it was supplied. The immediate super class will be cached in
  * "superclass" property of the new class.
  *
  * Methods in "props" will be copied and modified: "nom" property
  * (the declared name of the method) will be added to all copied
  * functions to help identify them for the internal machinery. Be
  * very careful, while reusing methods: if you use the same
  * function under different names, it can produce errors in some
  * cases.
  *
  * It is possible to use constructors created "manually" (without
  * declare()) as bases. They will be called as usual during the
  * creation of an instance, their methods will be chained, and even
  * called by "this.inherited()".
  *
  * Special property "-chains-" governs how to chain methods. It is
  * a dictionary, which uses method names as keys, and hint strings
  * as values. If a hint string is "after", this method will be
  * called after methods of its base classes. If a hint string is
  * "before", this method will be called before methods of its base
  * classes.
  *
  * If "constructor" is not mentioned in "-chains-" property, it will
  * be chained using the legacy mode: using "after" chaining,
  * calling preamble() method before each constructor, if available,
  * and calling postscript() after all constructors were executed.
  * If the hint is "after", it is chained as a regular method, but
  * postscript() will be called after the chain of constructors.
  * "constructor" cannot be chained "before", but it allows
  * a special hint string: "manual", which means that constructors
  * are not going to be chained in any way, and programmer will call
  * them manually using this.inherited(). In the latter case
  * postscript() will be called after the construction.
  *
  * All chaining hints are "inherited" from base classes and
  * potentially can be overridden. Be very careful when overriding
  * hints! Make sure that all chained methods can work in a proposed
  * manner of chaining.
  *
  * Once a method was chained, it is impossible to unchain it. The
  * only exception is "constructor". You don't need to define a
  * method in order to supply a chaining hint.
  *
  * If a method is chained, it cannot use this.inherited() because
  * all other methods in the hierarchy will be called automatically.
  *
  * Usually constructors and initializers of any kind are chained
  * using "after" and destructors of any kind are chained as
  * "before". Note that chaining assumes that chained methods do not
  * return any value: any returned value will be discarded.
  *
  * @param className       OptionalThe optional name of the constructor (loosely, a "class")stored in the "declaredClass" property in the created prototype.It will be used as a global name for a created constructor.
  * @param superclass May be null, a Function, or an Array of Functions. This argumentspecifies a list of bases (the left-most one is the most deepestbase).
  * @param props An object whose properties are copied to the created prototype.Add an instance-initialization function by making it a propertynamed "constructor".
