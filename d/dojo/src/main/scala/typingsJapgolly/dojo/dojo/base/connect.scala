  *
  * This module defines the dojo.connect API.
  * This modules also provides keyboard event handling helpers.
  * This module exports an extension event for emulating Firefox's keypress handling.
  * However, this extension event exists primarily for backwards compatibility and
  * is not recommended. WebKit and IE uses an alternate keypress handling (only
  * firing for printable characters, to distinguish from keydown events), and most
  * consider the WebKit/IE behavior more desirable.

  /**
    * dojo.connect is a deprecated event handling and delegation method in
    * Dojo. It allows one function to "listen in" on the execution of
    * any other, triggering the second whenever the first is called. Many
    * listeners may be attached to a function, and source functions may
    * be either regular function calls or DOM events.
    * Connects listeners to actions, so that after event fires, a
    * listener is called with the same arguments passed to the original
    * function.
    *
    * Since dojo.connect allows the source of events to be either a
    * "regular" JavaScript function or a DOM event, it provides a uniform
    * interface for listening to all the types of events that an
    * application is likely to deal with though a single, unified
    * interface. DOM programmers may want to think of it as
    * "addEventListener for everything and anything".
    *
    * When setting up a connection, the event parameter must be a
    * string that is the name of the method/event to be listened for. If
    * obj is null, kernel.global is assumed, meaning that connections
    * to global methods are supported but also that you may inadvertently
    * connect to a global by passing an incorrect object name or invalid
    * reference.
    *
    * dojo.connect generally is forgiving. If you pass the name of a
    * function or method that does not yet exist on obj, connect will
    * not fail, but will instead set up a stub method. Similarly, null
    * arguments may simply be omitted such that fewer than 4 arguments
    * may be required to set up a connection See the examples for details.
    *
    * The return value is a handle that is needed to
    * remove this connection with dojo.disconnect.
    *
    * @param obj               OptionalThe source object for the event function.Defaults to kernel.global if null.If obj is a DOM node, the connection is delegatedto the DOM event manager (unless dontFix is true).
    * @param event String name of the event function in obj.I.e. identifies a property obj[event].
    * @param context The object that method will receive as "this".If context is null and method is a function, then methodinherits the context of event.If method is a string then context must be the sourceobject object for method (context[method]). If context is null,kernel.global is used.
    * @param method A function reference, or name of a function in context.The function identified by method fires after event does.method receives the same arguments as the event.See context argument comments for information on method's scope.
    * @param dontFix               OptionalIf obj is a DOM node, set dontFix to true to prevent delegationof this connection to the DOM event manager.
