  *
  * Deprecated.   This module defines the legacy dojo/_base/Deferred API.
  * New code should use dojo/Deferred instead.
  * The Deferred API is based on the concept of promises that provide a
  * generic interface into the eventual completion of an asynchronous action.
  * The motivation for promises fundamentally is about creating a
  * separation of concerns that allows one to achieve the same type of
  * call patterns and logical data flow in asynchronous code as can be
  * achieved in synchronous code. Promises allows one
  * to be able to call a function purely with arguments needed for
  * execution, without conflating the call with concerns of whether it is
  * sync or async. One shouldn't need to alter a call's arguments if the
  * implementation switches from sync to async (or vice versa). By having
  * async functions return promises, the concerns of making the call are
  * separated from the concerns of asynchronous interaction (which are
  * handled by the promise).
  *
  * The Deferred is a type of promise that provides methods for fulfilling the
  * promise with a successful result or an error. The most important method for
  * working with Dojo's promises is the then() method, which follows the
  * CommonJS proposed promise API. An example of using a Dojo promise:
  *
  * var resultingPromise = someAsyncOperation.then(function(result){
  *     ... handle result ...
  * },
  * function(error){
  *     ... handle error ...
  * });
  * The .then() call returns a new promise that represents the result of the
  * execution of the callback. The callbacks will never affect the original promises value.
  *
  * The Deferred instances also provide the following functions for backwards compatibility:
  *
  * addCallback(handler)
  * addErrback(handler)
  * callback(result)
  * errback(result)
  * Callbacks are allowed to return promises themselves, so
  * you can build complicated sequences of events with ease.
  *
  * The creator of the Deferred may specify a canceller.  The canceller
  * is a function that will be called if Deferred.cancel is called
  * before the Deferred fires. You can use this to implement clean
  * aborting of an XMLHttpRequest, etc. Note that cancel will fire the
  * deferred with a CancelledError (unless your canceller returns
  * another kind of error), so the errbacks should be prepared to
  * handle that error for cancellable Deferreds.
  *
  * @param canceller       Optional
