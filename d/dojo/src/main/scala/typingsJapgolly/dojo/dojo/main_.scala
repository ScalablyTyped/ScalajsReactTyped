  /**
    * Deprecated.   This module defines the legacy dojo/_base/Deferred API.
    * New code should use dojo/Deferred instead.
    * The Deferred API is based on the concept of promises that provide a
    * generic interface into the eventual completion of an asynchronous action.
    * The motivation for promises fundamentally is about creating a
    * separation of concerns that allows one to achieve the same type of
    * call patterns and logical data flow in asynchronous code as can be
    * achieved in synchronous code. Promises allows one
    * to be able to call a function purely with arguments needed for
    * execution, without conflating the call with concerns of whether it is
    * sync or async. One shouldn't need to alter a call's arguments if the
    * implementation switches from sync to async (or vice versa). By having
    * async functions return promises, the concerns of making the call are
    * separated from the concerns of asynchronous interaction (which are
    * handled by the promise).
    *
    * The Deferred is a type of promise that provides methods for fulfilling the
    * promise with a successful result or an error. The most important method for
    * working with Dojo's promises is the then() method, which follows the
    * CommonJS proposed promise API. An example of using a Dojo promise:
    *
    * var resultingPromise = someAsyncOperation.then(function(result){
    *     ... handle result ...
    * },
    * function(error){
    *     ... handle error ...
    * });
    * The .then() call returns a new promise that represents the result of the
    * execution of the callback. The callbacks will never affect the original promises value.
    *
    * The Deferred instances also provide the following functions for backwards compatibility:
    *
    * addCallback(handler)
    * addErrback(handler)
    * callback(result)
    * errback(result)
    * Callbacks are allowed to return promises themselves, so
    * you can build complicated sequences of events with ease.
    *
    * The creator of the Deferred may specify a canceller.  The canceller
    * is a function that will be called if Deferred.cancel is called
    * before the Deferred fires. You can use this to implement clean
    * aborting of an XMLHttpRequest, etc. Note that cancel will fire the
    * deferred with a CancelledError (unless your canceller returns
    * another kind of error), so the errbacks should be prepared to
    * handle that error for cancellable Deferreds.
    *
    * @param canceller               Optional

  /**
    * loads a Javascript module from the appropriate URI
    * Modules are loaded via dojo.require by using one of two loaders: the normal loader
    * and the xdomain loader. The xdomain loader is used when dojo was built with a
    * custom build that specified loader=xdomain and the module lives on a modulePath
    * that is a whole URL, with protocol and a domain. The versions of Dojo that are on
    * the Google and AOL CDNs use the xdomain loader.
    *
    * If the module is loaded via the xdomain loader, it is an asynchronous load, since
    * the module is added via a dynamically created script tag. This
    * means that dojo.require() can return before the module has loaded. However, this
    * should only happen in the case where you do dojo.require calls in the top-level
    * HTML page, or if you purposely avoid the loader checking for dojo.require
    * dependencies in your module by using a syntax like dojo["require"] to load the module.
    *
    * Sometimes it is useful to not have the loader detect the dojo.require calls in the
    * module so that you can dynamically load the modules as a result of an action on the
    * page, instead of right at module load time.
    *
    * Also, for script blocks in an HTML page, the loader does not pre-process them, so
    * it does not know to download the modules before the dojo.require calls occur.
    *
    * So, in those two cases, when you want on-the-fly module loading or for script blocks
    * in the HTML page, special care must be taken if the dojo.required code is loaded
    * asynchronously. To make sure you can execute code that depends on the dojo.required
    * modules, be sure to add the code that depends on the modules in a dojo.addOnLoad()
    * callback. dojo.addOnLoad waits for all outstanding modules to finish loading before
    * executing.
    *
    * This type of syntax works with both xdomain and normal loaders, so it is good
    * practice to always use this idiom for on-the-fly code loading and in HTML script
    * blocks. If at some point you change loaders and where the code is loaded from,
    * it will all still work.
    *
    * More on how dojo.require
    * dojo.require("A.B") first checks to see if symbol A.B is
    * defined. If it is, it is simply returned (nothing to do).
    *
    * If it is not defined, it will look for A/B.js in the script root
    * directory.
    *
    * dojo.require throws an exception if it cannot find a file
    * to load, or if the symbol A.B is not defined after loading.
    *
    * It returns the object A.B, but note the caveats above about on-the-fly loading and
    * HTML script blocks when the xdomain loader is loading a module.
    *
    * dojo.require() does nothing about importing symbols into
    * the current namespace.  It is presumed that the caller will
    * take care of that.
    *
    * @param moduleName module name to load, using periods for separators, e.g. "dojo.date.locale".  Module paths are de-referenced by dojo'sinternal mapping of locations to names and are disambiguated bylongest prefix. See dojo.registerModulePath() for details onregistering new modules.
    * @param omitModuleCheck               Optionalif true, omitModuleCheck skips the step of ensuring that theloaded file actually defines the symbol it is referenced by.For example if it called as dojo.require("a.b.c") and thefile located at a/b/c.js does not define an object a.b.c,and exception will be throws whereas no exception is raisedwhen called as dojo.require("a.b.c", true)
