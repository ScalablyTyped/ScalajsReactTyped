/**
  * Permalink: http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.9/dijit/tree/ForestStoreModel.html
  *
  * Interface between a dijit.Tree and a dojo.data store that doesn't have a root item,
  * a.k.a. a store that has multiple "top level" items.
  * Use this class to wrap a dojo.data store, making all the items matching the specified query
  * appear as children of a fabricated "root item".  If no query is specified then all the
  * items returned by fetch() on the underlying store become children of the root item.
  * This class allows dijit.Tree to assume a single root item, even if the store doesn't have one.
  * 
  * When using this class the developer must override a number of methods according to their app and
  * data, including:
  * 
  * onNewRootItem
  * onAddToRoot
  * onLeaveRoot
  * onNewItem
  * onSetItem
  * 
  * @param params
