/**
  * Permalink: http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.9/dijit/_KeyNavMixin.html
  *
  * A mixin to allow arrow key and letter key navigation of child or descendant widgets.
  * It can be used by dijit/_Container based widgets with a flat list of children,
  * or more complex widgets like dijit/Tree.
  * 
  * To use this mixin, the subclass must:
  * 
  * - Implement  _getNext(), _getFirst(), _getLast(), _onLeftArrow(), _onRightArrow()
  *   _onDownArrow(), _onUpArrow() methods to handle home/end/left/right/up/down keystrokes.
  *   Next and previous in this context refer to a linear ordering of the descendants used
  *   by letter key search.
  * - Set all descendants' initial tabIndex to "-1"; both initial descendants and any
  *   descendants added later, by for example addChild()
  * - Define childSelector to a function or string that identifies focusable descendant widgets
  * Also, child widgets must implement a focus() method.
  *
