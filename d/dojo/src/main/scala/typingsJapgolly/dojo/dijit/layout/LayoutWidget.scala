/**
  * Permalink: http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.9/dijit/layout/_LayoutWidget.html
  *
  * Base class for a _Container widget which is responsible for laying out its children.
  * Widgets which mixin this code must define layout() to manage placement and sizing of the children.
  * 
  * @param params Hash of initialization parameters for widget, including scalar values (like title, duration etc.)and functions, typically callbacks like onClick.The hash can contain any of the widget's properties, excluding read-only properties.     
  * @param srcNodeRef       OptionalIf a srcNodeRef (DOM node) is specified:use srcNodeRef.innerHTML as my contentsif this is a behavioral widget then apply behavior to that srcNodeRefotherwise, replace srcNodeRef with my generated DOM tree
