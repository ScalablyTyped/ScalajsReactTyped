/**
  * Permalink: http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.9/dijit/_CssStateMixin.html
  *
  * Mixin for widgets to set CSS classes on the widget DOM nodes depending on hover/mouse press/focus
  * state changes, and also higher-level state changes such becoming disabled or selected.
  * By mixing this class into your widget, and setting the this.baseClass attribute, it will automatically
  * maintain CSS classes on the widget root node (this.domNode) depending on hover,
  * active, focus, etc. state.   Ex: with a baseClass of dijitButton, it will apply the classes
  * dijitButtonHovered and dijitButtonActive, as the user moves the mouse over the widget and clicks it.
  * 
  * It also sets CSS like dijitButtonDisabled based on widget semantic state.
  * 
  * By setting the cssStateNodes attribute, a widget can also track events on subnodes (like buttons
  * within the widget).
  *
