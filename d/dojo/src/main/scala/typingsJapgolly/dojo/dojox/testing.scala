    *
    * This class executes doctests.
    * DocTests are tests that are defined inside the comment.
    * A doctest looks as if it was copied from the shell (which it mostly is).
    * A doctest is executed when the following conditions match:
    * 1) all lines are comments
    * 2) the line always starts with spaces/tabs followed by "//"
    *    and at least one space
    * 3) the line(s) of the test to execute starts with ">>>"
    *    preceeded by what is described in 2)
    * 4) the first line after 3) starting without ">>>" is the exptected result.
    *    preceeded by what is described in 2)
    * 5) the test sequence is terminated by an empty line, or the next
    *    test in the following line, or a new line that does not start as described in 2)
    *    (simple said: is not a comment)
    *    preceeded by what is described in 2)
    *
    * I.e. the following is a simple doctest, that will actually also be run
    * if you run this class against this file here:
    *
    *
    * 1+1 // A simple test case. Terminated by an empty line
    * 2
    *
    * 1==2
    * false
    * "a"+"b" // Also without the empty line before, this is a new test.
    * "ab"
    *
    * var anything = "anything" // Multiple commands for one test.
    * "something"==anything
    * false
    *
    *
    * DocTests are great for inline documenting a class or method, they also
    * are very helpful in understanding what the class/method actually does.
    * They don't make sense everywhere, but sometimes they are really handy.
    *
