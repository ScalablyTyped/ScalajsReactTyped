/**
  * Permalink: http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.9/dojox/analytics/Urchin.html
  *
  * A Google-analytics helper, for post-onLoad inclusion of the tracker, and
  * dynamic tracking during long-lived page cycles.
  * A small class object will allows for lazy-loading the Google Analytics API
  * at any point during a page lifecycle. Most commonly, Google-Analytics is loaded
  * via a synchronous script tag in the body, which causes dojo.addOnLoad to
  * stall until the external API has been completely loaded. The Urchin helper
  * will load the API on the fly, and provide a convenient API to use, wrapping
  * Analytics for Ajaxy or single page applications.
  *
  * The class can be instantiated two ways: Programatically, by passing an
  * acct: parameter, or via Markup / dojoType and defining a djConfig
  * parameter urchin:
  *
  * IMPORTANT:
  * This module will not work simultaneously with the core dojox.analytics
  * package. If you need the ability to run Google Analytics AND your own local
  * analytics system, you MUST include dojox.analytics._base BEFORE dojox.analytics.Urchin
  *
