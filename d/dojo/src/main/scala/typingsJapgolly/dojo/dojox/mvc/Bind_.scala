    * An inheritance of native JavaScript array, that adds dojo/Stateful capability.
    * Supported methods are:
    *
    * pop() - watchElements() notification is done for the removed elements. watch() notification is done for the length.
    * push() - watchElements() notification is done for the added elements. watch() notification is done for the length.
    * reverse() - watchElements() notification is done, indicating that the change affects all elements.
    * shift() - watchElements() notification is done for the removed elements. watch() notification is done for the length.
    * sort() - watchElements() notification is done, indicating that the change affects all elements.
    * splice() - watchElements() notification is done for the removed/added elements. watch() notification is done for the length. Returns an instance of StatefulArray instead of the native array.
    * unshift() - watchElements() notification is done for the added elements. watch() notification is done for the length.
    * concat() - Returns an instance of StatefulArray instead of the native Array.
    * join() - The length as well as the elements are obtained via stateful getters, instead of direct access.
    * slice() - The length as well as the elements are obtained via stateful getters, instead of direct access.
    * Setting an element to this array via set() - watch() notification is done for the new element as well as the new length.
    * Setting a length to this array via set() - watchElements() notification is done for the removed/added elements. watch() notification is done for the new length.
