/**
  * Permalink: http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.9/dojox/form/uploader/_Flash.html
  *
  * A mixin for dojox/form/Uploader that utilizes a Flash SWF for handling to upload in IE.
  * All other browsers will use the HTML5 plugin, unless force="flash" is used, then Flash
  * will be used in all browsers. force="flash" is provided because Flash has some features
  * that HTML5 does not yet have. But it is still not recommended because of the many problems
  * that Firefox and Webkit have with the Flash plugin.
  * All properties and methods listed here are specific to the Flash version only.
  *
