  *
  * Drawing is a project that sits on top of DojoX GFX and uses SVG and
  * VML vector graphics to draw and display.
  * Drawing is similar to DojoX Sketch, but is designed to be more versatile
  * extendable and customizable.
  * Drawing currently only initiates from HTML although it's technically not
  * a Dijit to keep the file size light. But if Dijit is available, Drawing
  * will register itself with it and can be accessed with registry.byId('myDrawing')
  * (by requiring dijit/registry)
  *
  * NOTES:
  * Although not Drawing and Toolbar, all other objects are created with a custom
  * declare. See dojox.drawing.util.oo
  *
  * The files are laid out as such:
  *
  * Drawing: The master class. More than one instance of a Drawing can be placed
  *   on a page at one time (although this has not yet been tested). Plugins
  *   can be added in markup.
  * Toolbar: Like Drawing, Toolbar is a psudeo Dijit that does not need Dijit. It is
  *   optional. It can be oriented horizontal or vertical by placing one of
  *   those params in the class (at least one is required).  Plugins
  *   can be added in markup. A drawingId is required to point toolbar to
  *   the drawing.
  * defaults: Contains the default styles and dimensions for Stencils. An individual
  *   Stencil can be changed by calling stencil.att({color obj}); To change
  *   all styles, a custom defaults file should be used.
  * Stencils: Drawing uses a concept of 'Stencils' to avoid confusion between a
  *   Dojox Shape and a Drawing Shape. The classes in the 'stencils' package
  *   are display only, they are not used for actually drawing (see 'tools').
  *   This package contains _Base from which stencils inherit most of their
  *   methods. (Path and Image are display only and not found in Tools)
  * Tools: The Tools package contains Stencils that are attached to mouse events
  *   and can be used for drawing. Items in this package can also be selected
  *   and modified.
  * Tools / Custom: Holds tools that do not directly extend Stencil base classes and often
  *   have very custom code.
  * Library (not implemented): The Library package, which is not yet implemented, will be the place to
  *   hold stencils that have very specific data points that result in a picture.
  *   Flag-like-banners, fancy borders, or other complex shapes would go here.
  * Annotations: Annotations 'decorate' and attach to other Stencils, such as a 'Label'
  *   that can show text on a stencil, or an 'Angle' that shows while dragging
  *   or modifying a Vector, or an Arrow head that is attached to the beginning
  *   or end of a line.
  * Manager: Contains classes that control functionality of a Drawing.
  * Plugins: Contains optional classes that are 'plugged into' a Drawing. There are two
  *   types: 'drawing' plugins that modify the canvas, and 'tools' which would
  *   show in the toolbar.
  * Util: A collection of common tasks.
