/**
  * Permalink: http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.9/dojox/mobile/View.html
  *
  * A widget that represents a view that occupies the full screen
  * View is a container widget for any HTML element and/or Dojo widgets.
  * As a Dojo widget container it can itself contain View widgets
  * forming a set of nested views. A Dojo Mobile application is usually
  * made of multiple View widgets and the user can navigate through
  * the views back and forth with animated transition effects.
  *
  * When using several sibling views (direct children of the same
  * element), you can use the 'selected' attribute to define whether
  * the view should be displayed when the application is launched.
  * If no view has selected=true, the first sibling view is displayed
  * at startup time.
  *
  * @param params Contains the parameters.
  * @param node       OptionalThe DOM node. If none is specified, it is automatically created.
