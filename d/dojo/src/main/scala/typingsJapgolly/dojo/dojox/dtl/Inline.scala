    * Deprecated. Instead of attributeMap, widget should have a _setXXXAttr attribute
    * for each XXX attribute to be mapped to the DOM.
    *
    * attributeMap sets up a "binding" between attributes (aka properties)
    * of the widget and the widget's DOM.
    * Changes to widget attributes listed in attributeMap will be
    * reflected into the DOM.
    *
    * For example, calling set('title', 'hello')
    * on a TitlePane will automatically cause the TitlePane's DOM to update
    * with the new title.
    *
    * attributeMap is a hash where the key is an attribute of the widget,
    * and the value reflects a binding to a:
    *
    * DOM node attribute
    *   focus: {node: "focusNode", type: "attribute"}
    * Maps this.focus to this.focusNode.focus
    *
    * DOM node innerHTML
    *   title: { node: "titleNode", type: "innerHTML" }
    * Maps this.title to this.titleNode.innerHTML
    *
    * DOM node innerText
    *   title: { node: "titleNode", type: "innerText" }
    * Maps this.title to this.titleNode.innerText
    *
    * DOM node CSS class
    *   myClass: { node: "domNode", type: "class" }
    * Maps this.myClass to this.domNode.className
    *
    * If the value is an array, then each element in the array matches one of the
    * formats of the above list.
    *
    * There are also some shorthands for backwards compatibility:
    *
    * string --> { node: string, type: "attribute" }, for example:
    * "focusNode" ---> { node: "focusNode", type: "attribute" }
