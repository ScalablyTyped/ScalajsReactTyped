  * The main chart object in dojox.charting.  This will create a two dimensional
  * chart based on dojox.gfx.
  * dojox.charting.Chart is the primary object used for any kind of charts.  It
  * is simple to create--just pass it a node reference, which is used as the
  * container for the chart--and a set of optional keyword arguments and go.
  *
  * Note that like most of dojox.gfx, most of dojox.charting.Chart's methods are
  * designed to return a reference to the chart itself, to allow for functional
  * chaining.  This makes defining everything on a Chart very easy to do.
