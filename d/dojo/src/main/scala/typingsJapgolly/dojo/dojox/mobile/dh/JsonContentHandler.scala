/**
  * Permalink: http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.9/dojox/mobile/dh/JsonContentHandler.html
  *
  * A JSON content handler.
  * This module is a content handler that creates a view from JSON
  * data. If widgets used in the JSON data are not available, they
  * are loaded automatically before instantiation.
  *
  * There are two formats as shown in the examples below. You can
  * choose either of them. The v1.7 format can be more compact, but
  * if you want multiple widgets at the same level, they must be in
  * an array. So, you can have, for example, two consecutive
  * RoundRectLists, but you cannot have, for example,
  * RoundRectCategory, RoundRectList, RoundRectCategory, and
  * RoundRectList, because they are keys in one JS object, which
  * causes conflict. The v1.8 format has no such limitation.
  *
