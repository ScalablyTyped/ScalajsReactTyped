/**
  * Permalink: http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.9/dojox/timing/Sequence.html
  *
  * This class provides functionality to really sequentialize
  * function calls. You need to provide a list of functions and
  * some parameters for each (like: pauseBefore) and they will
  * be run one after another. This can be very useful for slideshows
  * or alike things.
  * This array will contain the sequence defines resolved, so that
  * ie. repeat:10 will result in 10 elements in the sequence, so
  * the repeat handling is easier and we don't need to handle that
  * many extra cases. Also the doneFunction, if given is added at the
  * end of the resolved-sequences.
