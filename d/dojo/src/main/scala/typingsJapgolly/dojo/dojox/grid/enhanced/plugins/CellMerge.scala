/**
  * Permalink: http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.9/dojox/grid/enhanced/plugins/CellMerge.html
  *
  * This plugin provides functions to merge(un-merge) adjacent cells within one row.
  * Acceptable plugin parameters:
  *
  * mergedCells: Array: An array of objects with structure:
  * {
  *     row: function(Integer)|Integer
  *         If it's a function, it's a predicate to decide which rows are to be merged.
  *         It takes an integer (the row index), and should return true or false;
  *     start: Integer
  *         The column index of the left most cell that shall be merged.
  *     end: Integer
  *         The column index of the right most cell that shall be merged.
  *     major: Integer
  *         The column index of the cell whose content should be used as the content of the merged cell.
  *         It must be larger than or equal to the startColumnIndex, and less than or equal to the endColumnIndex.
  *         If it is omitted, the content of the leading edge (left-most for ltr, right most for rtl) cell will be used.
  * }
  *
