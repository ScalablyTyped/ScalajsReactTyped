/**
  * Permalink: http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.9/dojox/embed/flashVars.html
  *
  * Handles flashvar serialization
  * Converting complex objects into a simple, clear string that can be appended
  * to the swf as a query: myMovie.swf?flashvars=foo.
  * Note this needs to work with the SWF, which must know what variables to expect.
  * Therefore this is something of an "internal" class - unless you know how to
  * modify or create SWFs.
  * JSON could be done, but Deft does not yet have a JSON parser, and quotes are
  * very problematic since Flash cannot use eval(); JSON parsing was successful
  * when it was fully escaped, but that made it very large anyway. flashvar
  * serialization at most is 200% larger than JSON.
