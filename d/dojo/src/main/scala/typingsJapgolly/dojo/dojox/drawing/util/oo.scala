  * Inheritance utilities used in DojoX Drawing.
  * There were designed in a effort to make Drawing as
  * fast as possible - especially in a case where thousands
  * of objects are being loaded. Drawing declare performs
  * about 3 times faster than declare and 2 times
  * faster than Dojox declare. This is not to say Drawing
  * declare is without limitations. It doesn't have the same
  * syntactic sugar and extensibility of the other two. You
  * can't inherit methods. It won't work with Dijit. But it
  * is simple and effective.
