  *
  * Deprecated.  Use dojox/mvc/at for data binding.
  * Provides the ability for dijits or custom view components to become
  * data binding aware.
  * Data binding awareness enables dijits or other view layer
  * components to bind to locations within a client-side data model,
  * which is commonly an instance of the dojox/mvc/StatefulModel class. A
  * bind is a bi-directional update mechanism which is capable of
  * synchronizing value changes between the bound dijit or other view
  * component and the specified location within the data model, as well
  * as changes to other properties such as "valid", "required",
  * "readOnly" etc.
  *
  * The data binding is commonly specified declaratively via the "ref"
  * property in the "data-dojo-props" attribute value.
  *
  * Consider the following simple example:
  *
  * <script>
  *     var model;
  *     require(["dijit/StatefulModel", "dojo/parser"], function(StatefulModel, parser){
  *         model = new StatefulModel({ data : {
  *             hello : "Hello World"
  *         }});
  *         parser.parse();
  *     });
  * </script>
  * <input id="hello1" data-dojo-type="dijit/form/TextBox"
  *     data-dojo-props="ref: model.hello"></input>
  * <input id="hello2" data-dojo-type="dijit/form/TextBox"
  *     data-dojo-props="ref: model.hello"></input>
  * In the above example, both dijit/form/TextBox instances (with IDs
  * "hello1" and "hello2" respectively) are bound to the same reference
  * location in the data model i.e. "hello" via the "ref" expression
  * "model.hello". Both will have an initial value of "Hello World".
  * Thereafter, a change in the value of either of the two textboxes
  * will cause an update of the value in the data model at location
  * "hello" which will in turn cause a matching update of the value in
  * the other textbox.
  *
