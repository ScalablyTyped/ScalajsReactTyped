/**
  * Permalink: http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.9/dojox/mobile/FilteredListMixin.html
  *
  * Mixin for filtered lists.
  * This mixin adds filtering capabilities to all dojox/mobile list widgets:
  * dojox/mobile/RoundRectList and any of its subclasses (RoundRectStoreList,
  * RoundRectDataList, EdgeToEdgeList, EdgeToEdgeStoreList, EdgeToEdgeDataList).
  * When mixing this class into a list widget, the list items are dynamically
  * filtered depending on the filtering string that the user enters in a
  * dojox/mobile/SearchBox.
  *
  * This mixin supports the following use-cases:
  * 1. For user's convenience, by simply mixing this class into a list widget
  * the mixin creates a dojox/mobile/SearchBox and a dojox/mobile/ScrollableView.
  * The list is placed inside the ScrollableView and the SearchBox, which allows
  * filtering the list, is placed on top of the ScrollableView.
  * 2. Alternatively, the user can create (and style) the instance of dojox/mobile/SearchBox,
  * and specify its id using the property filterBoxRef of this mixin. This allows
  * placing the SearchBox anywhere in the DOM, while the mixin takes care of
  * the necessary glue to ensure the list is filtered according to the filter criteria
  * entered in the SearchBox.
  *
  * The filtering works for lists backed by a store (dojo/store or dojo/data), as well
  * as for lists not backed by a store. When filtering a list backed by a store
  * containing hierarchical data (data items that are children of a parent data item),
  * the store must support recursive search queries such that the filtering can match
  * child items.
  *
  * For configuration purposes, the instance of dojox/mobile/SearchBox can be retrieved
  * using the method getFilterBox(). If a dojox/mobile/ScrollableView is created by
  * this mixin, it can be retrieved using getScrollableView().
  *
