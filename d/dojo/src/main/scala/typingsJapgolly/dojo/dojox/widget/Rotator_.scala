/**
  * Permalink: http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.9/dojox/widget/Rotator.html
  *
  * A widget for rotating through child nodes using transitions.
  * A small, fast, extensible, awesome rotator that cycles, with transitions,
  * through panes (child nodes) displaying only one at a time and ties into
  * controllers used to change state.
  *
  * The Rotator does not rely on dijit.  It is designed to be as lightweight
  * as possible.  Controllers and transitions have been externalized
  * so builds can be as optimized with only the components you want to use.
  *
  * For best results, each rotator pane should be the same height and width as
  * the Rotator container node and consider setting overflow to hidden.
  * While the Rotator will accept any DOM node for a rotator pane, a block
  * element or element with display:block is recommended.
  *
  * Note: When the Rotator begins, it does not transition the first pane.
  *
  * subscribed topics:
  *
  * [id]/rotator/control - Controls the Rotator
  * Parameters:
  * - //string// action        - The name of a method of the Rotator to run
  * - //anything?// args       - One or more arguments to pass to the action
  * published topics:
  *
  * [id]/rotator/update - Notifies controllers that a pane or state has changed.
  * Parameters:
  *
  * /string/ type          - the type of notification
  * /dojox.widget.Rotator/ rotator - the rotator instance
  * /object?/ params         - params
  * declarative dojo/method events (per pane):
  *
  * onBeforeIn  - Fired before the transition in starts.
  * onAfterIn   - Fired after the transition in ends.
  * onBeforeOut - Fired before the transition out starts.
  * onAfterOut  - Fired after the transition out ends.
  *
  * @param params
  * @param node
