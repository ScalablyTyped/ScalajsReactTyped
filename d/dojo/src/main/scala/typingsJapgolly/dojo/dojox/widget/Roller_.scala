/**
  * Permalink: http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.9/dojox/widget/Roller.html
  *
  * A simple widget to take an unordered-list of Text and roll through them
  * The Roller widget takes an unordered-list of items, and converts
  * them to a single-area (the size of one list-item, however you so choose
  * to style it) and loops continually, fading between items.
  *
  * In it's current state, it requires it be created from an unordered (or ordered)
  * list, though can contain complex markup.
  *
  * You can manipulate the items array at any point during the cycle with
  * standard array manipulation techniques.
  *
  * The class "dojoxRoller" is added to the UL element for styling purposes.
  *
