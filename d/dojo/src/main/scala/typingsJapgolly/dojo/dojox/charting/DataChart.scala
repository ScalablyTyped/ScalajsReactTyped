/**
  * Permalink: http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.9/dojox/charting/DataChart.html
  *
  * Extension to the 2D chart that connects to a data store in
  * a simple manner. Convenience methods have been added for
  * connecting store item labels to the chart labels.
  * This code should be considered very experimental and the APIs subject
  * to change. This is currently an alpha version and will need some testing
  * and review.
  *
  * The main reason for this extension is to create animated charts, generally
  * available with scroll=true, and a property field that gets continually updated.
  * The previous property settings are kept in memory and displayed until scrolled
  * off the chart.
  *
  * Although great effort was made to maintain the integrity of the current
  * charting APIs, some things have been added or modified in order to get
  * the store to connect and also to get the data to scroll/animate.
  * "displayRange" in particular is used to force the xaxis to a specific
  * size and keep the chart from stretching or squashing to fit the data.
  *
  * Currently, plot lines can only be set at initialization. Setting
  * a new store query will have no effect (although using setStore
  * may work but its untested).
  *
  * @param node The node to attach the chart to.
  * @param kwArgs xaxis: Object: optional parameters for xaxis (see above)yaxis: Object: optional parameters for yaxis (see above)store: Object: dojo.data store (currently nly supports Persevere)xaxis: Object: First query for storegrid: Object: Options for the grid plotchartPlot: Object: Options for chart elements (lines, bars, etc)
