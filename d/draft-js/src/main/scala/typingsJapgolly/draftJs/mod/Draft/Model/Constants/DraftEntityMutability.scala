/**
  * Possible "mutability" options for an entity. This refers to the behavior
  * that should occur when inserting or removing characters in a text range
  * with an entity applied to it.
  *
  * `MUTABLE`:
  *   The text range can be modified freely. Generally used in cases where
  *   the text content and the entity do not necessarily have a direct
  *   relationship. For instance, the text and URI for a link may be completely
  *   different. The user is allowed to edit the text as needed, and the entity
  *   is preserved and applied to any characters added within the range.
  *
  * `IMMUTABLE`:
  *   Not to be confused with immutable data structures used to represent the
  *   state of the editor. Immutable entity ranges cannot be modified in any
  *   way. Adding characters within the range will remove the entity from the
  *   entire range. Deleting characters will delete the entire range. Example:
  *   Facebook Page mentions.
  *
  * `SEGMENTED`:
  *   Segmented entities allow the removal of partial ranges of text, as
  *   separated by a delimiter. Adding characters wihin the range will remove
  *   the entity from the entire range. Deleting characters within a segmented
  *   entity will delete only the segments affected by the deletion. Example:
  *   Facebook User mentions.
