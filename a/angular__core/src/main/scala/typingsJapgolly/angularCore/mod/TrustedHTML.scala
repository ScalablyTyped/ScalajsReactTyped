/**
  * @fileoverview
  * While Angular only uses Trusted Types internally for the time being,
  * references to Trusted Types could leak into our core.d.ts, which would force
  * anyone compiling against @angular/core to provide the @types/trusted-types
  * package in their compilation unit.
  *
  * Until https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/30024 is resolved, we
  * will keep Angular's public API surface free of references to Trusted Types.
  * For internal and semi-private APIs that need to reference Trusted Types, the
  * minimal type definitions for the Trusted Types API provided by this module
  * should be used instead. They are marked as "declare" to prevent them from
  * being renamed by compiler optimization.
  *
  * Adapted from
  * https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/trusted-types/index.d.ts
  * but restricted to the API surface used within Angular.
