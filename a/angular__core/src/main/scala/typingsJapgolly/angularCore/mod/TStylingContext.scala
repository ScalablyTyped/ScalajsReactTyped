/**
  * A static-level representation of all style or class bindings/values
  * associated with a `TNode`.
  *
  * The `TStylingContext` unites all template styling bindings (i.e.
  * `[class]` and `[style]` bindings) as well as all host-level
  * styling bindings (for components and directives) together into
  * a single manifest. It is used each time there are one or more
  * styling bindings present for an element.
  *
  * The styling context is stored on a `TNode` on and there are
  * two instances of it: one for classes and another for styles.
  *
  * ```typescript
  * tNode.styles = [ ... a context only for styles ... ];
  * tNode.classes = [ ... a context only for classes ... ];
  * ```
  *
  * `tNode.styles` and `tNode.classes` can be an instance of the following:
  *
  * ```typescript
  * tNode.styles = null; // no static styling or styling bindings active
  * tNode.styles = StylingMapArray; // only static values present (e.g. `<div style="width:200">`)
  * tNode.styles = TStylingContext; // one or more styling bindings present (e.g. `<div
  * [style.width]>`)
  * ```
  *
  * Both `tNode.styles` and `tNode.classes` are instantiated when anything
  * styling-related is active on an element. They are first created from
  * from the any of the element-level instructions (e.g. `element`,
  * `elementStart`, `elementHostAttrs`). When any static style/class
  * values are encountered they are registered on the `tNode.styles`
  * and `tNode.classes` data-structures. By default (when any static
  * values are encountered) the `tNode.styles` or `tNode.classes` values
  * are instances of a `StylingMapArray`. Only when style/class bindings
  * are detected then that styling map is converted into an instance of
  * `TStylingContext`.
  *
  * Due to the fact the the `TStylingContext` is stored on a `TNode`
  * this means that all data within the context is static. Instead of
  * storing actual styling binding values, the lView binding index values
  * are stored within the context. (static nature means it is more compact.)
  *
  * ```typescript
  * // <div [class.active]="c"  // lView binding index = 20
  * //      [style.width]="x"   // lView binding index = 21
  * //      [style.height]="y"> // lView binding index = 22
  * tNode.stylesContext = [
  *   [], // initial values array
  *   0, // the context config value
  *
  *   0b001, // guard mask for width
  *   2, // total entries for width
  *   'width', // the property name
  *   21, // the binding location for the "x" binding in the lView
  *   null,
  *
  *   0b010, // guard mask for height
  *   2, // total entries for height
  *   'height', // the property name
  *   22, // the binding location for the "y" binding in the lView
  *   null,
  * ];
  *
  * tNode.classesContext = [
  *   [], // initial values array
  *   0, // the context config value
  *
  *   0b001, // guard mask for active
  *   2, // total entries for active
  *   'active', // the property name
  *   20, // the binding location for the "c" binding in the lView
  *   null,
  * ];
  * ```
  *
  * Entry value present in an entry (called a tuple) within the
  * styling context is as follows:
  *
  * ```typescript
  * context = [
  *   CONFIG, // the styling context config value
  *   //...
  *   guardMask,
  *   totalEntries,
  *   propName,
  *   bindingIndices...,
  *   defaultValue
  * ];
  * ```
  *
  * Below is a breakdown of each value:
  *
  * - **guardMask**:
  *   A numeric value where each bit represents a binding index
  *   location. Each binding index location is assigned based on
  *   a local counter value that increments each time an instruction
  *   is called:
  *
  * ```
  * <div [style.width]="x"   // binding index = 21 (counter index = 0)
  *      [style.height]="y"> // binding index = 22 (counter index = 1)
  * ```
  *
  *   In the example code above, if the `width` value where to change
  *   then the first bit in the local bit mask value would be flipped
  *   (and the second bit for when `height`).
  *
  *   If and when there are more than 32 binding sources in the context
  *   (more than 32 `[style/class]` bindings) then the bit masking will
  *   overflow and we are left with a situation where a `-1` value will
  *   represent the bit mask. Due to the way that JavaScript handles
  *   negative values, when the bit mask is `-1` then all bits within
  *   that value will be automatically flipped (this is a quick and
  *   efficient way to flip all bits on the mask when a special kind
  *   of caching scenario occurs or when there are more than 32 bindings).
  *
  * - **totalEntries**:
  *   Each property present in the contains various binding sources of
  *   where the styling data could come from. This includes template
  *   level bindings, directive/component host bindings as well as the
  *   default value (or static value) all writing to the same property.
  *   This value depicts how many binding source entries exist for the
  *   property.
  *
  *   The reason why the totalEntries value is needed is because the
  *   styling context is dynamic in size and it's not possible
  *   for the flushing or update algorithms to know when and where
  *   a property starts and ends without it.
  *
  * - **propName**:
  *   The CSS property name or class name (e.g `width` or `active`).
  *
  * - **bindingIndices...**:
  *   A series of numeric binding values that reflect where in the
  *   lView to find the style/class values associated with the property.
  *   Each value is in order in terms of priority (templates are first,
  *   then directives and then components). When the context is flushed
  *   and the style/class values are applied to the element (this happens
  *   inside of the `stylingApply` instruction) then the flushing code
  *   will keep checking each binding index against the associated lView
  *   to find the first style/class value that is non-null.
  *
  * - **defaultValue**:
  *   This is the default that will always be applied to the element if
  *   and when all other binding sources return a result that is null.
  *   Usually this value is null but it can also be a static value that
  *   is intercepted when the tNode is first constructured (e.g.
  *   `<div style="width:200px">` has a default value of `200px` for
  *   the `width` property).
  *
  * Each time a new binding is encountered it is registered into the
  * context. The context then is continually updated until the first
  * styling apply call has been called (this is triggered by the
  * `stylingApply()` instruction for the active element).
  *
  * # How Styles/Classes are Rendered
  * Each time a styling instruction (e.g. `[class.name]`, `[style.prop]`,
  * etc...) is executed, the associated `lView` for the view is updated
  * at the current binding location. Also, when this happens, a local
  * counter value is incremented. If the binding value has changed then
  * a local `bitMask` variable is updated with the specific bit based
  * on the counter value.
  *
  * Below is a lightweight example of what happens when a single style
  * property is updated (i.e. `<div [style.prop]="val">`):
  *
  * ```typescript
  * function updateStyleProp(prop: string, value: string) {
  *   const lView = getLView();
  *   const bindingIndex = BINDING_INDEX++;
  *   const indexForStyle = localStylesCounter++;
  *   if (lView[bindingIndex] !== value) {
  *     lView[bindingIndex] = value;
  *     localBitMaskForStyles |= 1 << indexForStyle;
  *   }
  * }
  * ```
  *
  * ## The Apply Algorithm
  * As explained above, each time a binding updates its value, the resulting
  * value is stored in the `lView` array. These styling values have yet to
  * be flushed to the element.
  *
  * Once all the styling instructions have been evaluated, then the styling
  * context(s) are flushed to the element. When this happens, the context will
  * be iterated over (property by property) and each binding source will be
  * examined and the first non-null value will be applied to the element.
  *
  * Let's say that we the following template code:
  *
  * ```html
  * <div [style.width]="w1" dir-that-set-width="w2"></div>
  * ```
  *
  * There are two styling bindings in the code above and they both write
  * to the `width` property. When styling is flushed on the element, the
  * algorithm will try and figure out which one of these values to write
  * to the element.
  *
  * In order to figure out which value to apply, the following
  * binding prioritization is adhered to:
  *
  *   1. First template-level styling bindings are applied (if present).
  *      This includes things like `[style.width]` and `[class.active]`.
  *
  *   2. Second are styling-level host bindings present in directives.
  *      (if there are sub/super directives present then the sub directives
  *      are applied first).
  *
  *   3. Third are styling-level host bindings present in components.
  *      (if there are sub/super components present then the sub directives
  *      are applied first).
  *
  * This means that in the code above the styling binding present in the
  * template is applied first and, only if its falsy, then the directive
  * styling binding for width will be applied.
  *
  * ### What about map-based styling bindings?
  * Map-based styling bindings are activated when there are one or more
  * `[style]` and/or `[class]` bindings present on an element. When this
  * code is activated, the apply algorithm will iterate over each map
  * entry and apply each styling value to the element with the same
  * prioritization rules as above.
  *
  * For the algorithm to apply styling values efficiently, the
  * styling map entries must be applied in sync (property by property)
  * with prop-based bindings. (The map-based algorithm is described
  * more inside of the `render3/styling_next/map_based_bindings.ts` file.)
  *
  * ## Sanitization
  * Sanitization is used to prevent invalid style values from being applied to
  * the element.
  *
  * It is enabled in two cases:
  *
  *   1. The `styleSanitizer(sanitizerFn)` instruction was called (just before any other
  *      styling instructions are run).
  *
  *   2. The component/directive `LView` instance has a sanitizer object attached to it
  *      (this happens when `renderComponent` is executed with a `sanitizer` value or
  *      if the ngModule contains a sanitizer provider attached to it).
  *
  * If and when sanitization is active then all property/value entries will be evaluated
  * through the active sanitizer before they are applied to the element (or the styling
  * debug handler).
  *
  * If a `Sanitizer` object is used (via the `LView[SANITIZER]` value) then that object
  * will be used for every property.
  *
  * If a `StyleSanitizerFn` function is used (via the `styleSanitizer`) then it will be
  * called in two ways:
  *
  *   1. property validation mode: this will be called early to mark whether a property
  *      should be sanitized or not at during the flushing stage.
  *
  *   2. value sanitization mode: this will be called during the flushing stage and will
  *      run the sanitizer function against the value before applying it to the element.
  *
  * If sanitization returns an empty value then that empty value will be applied
  * to the element.
