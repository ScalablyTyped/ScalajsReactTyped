    *      `<ng-content/><ng-content select="abc"/>` would represent the heads for `<ng-content/>`
    *      and `<ng-content select="abc"/>` respectively.
    *    - The nodes we store in `projection` are heads only, we used `.next` to get their
    *      siblings.
    *    - The nodes `.next` is sorted/rewritten as part of the projection setup.
    *    - `projection` size is equal to the number of projections `<ng-content>`. The size of

    * - we store `projection` with the host (`c1`, `c2`) rather than the `<ng-content>` (`cont1`)

    *   a result have different set of nodes to project.
    * - without `projection` it would be difficult to efficiently traverse nodes to be projected.
    *
    * If `typeof projection == 'number'` then `TNode` is a `<ng-content>` element:
    * - `projection` is an index of the host's `projection`Nodes.
    *   - This would return the first head node to project:
    *     `getHost(currentTNode).projection[currentTNode.projection]`.
