    * Bootstrap a component onto the element identified by its selector or, optionally, to a
    * specified element.
    *
    * @usageNotes
    * ### Bootstrap process
    *
    * When bootstrapping a component, Angular mounts it onto a target DOM element
    * and kicks off automatic change detection. The target DOM element can be
    * provided using the `rootSelectorOrNode` argument.
    *
    * If the target DOM element is not provided, Angular tries to find one on a page
    * using the `selector` of the component that is being bootstrapped
    * (first matched element is used).
    *
    * ### Example
    *
    * Generally, we define the component to bootstrap in the `bootstrap` array of `NgModule`,
    * but it requires us to know the component while writing the application code.
    *
    * Imagine a situation where we have to wait for an API call to decide about the component to
    * bootstrap. We can use the `ngDoBootstrap` hook of the `NgModule` and call this method to
    * dynamically bootstrap a component.
    *
    * {@example core/ts/platform/platform.ts region='componentSelector'}
    *
    * Optionally, a component can be mounted onto a DOM element that does not match the
    * selector of the bootstrapped component.
    *
    * In the following example, we are providing a CSS selector to match the target element.
    *
    * {@example core/ts/platform/platform.ts region='cssSelector'}
    *
    * While in this example, we are providing reference to a DOM node.
    *
    * {@example core/ts/platform/platform.ts region='domNode'}
    *
    * @deprecated Passing Component factories as the `Application.bootstrap` function argument is
    *     deprecated. Pass Component Types instead.
