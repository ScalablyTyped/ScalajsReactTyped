    * @param identifier A unique identifier to identify this individual upload stream.
    * Must be an alphanumeric string including spaces, commas, periods, hyphens, and underscores with length between 1 and 255.
    * @param iotChannel The name of the IoT Analytics Channel that this exporter should upload to.
    * @param iotMsgIdPrefix A string prefixed to each unique message id. After this prefix, StreamManager may append
    * more data to make the message ID unique.
    * This prefix must be less than 32 characters.
    * @param batchSize The maximum size of a batch to send to IoT Analytics. Messages will be queued until the batch size is reached,
    * after which they will then be uploaded.
    * If unspecified the default will be 100.
    * If both batchSize and batchIntervalMillis are specified, then messages will be eligible for upload when either condition is met.
    * The batch size must be between 1 and 100.
    * @param batchIntervalMillis The time in milliseconds between the earliest un-uploaded message and the current time.
    * If this time is exceeded, messages will be uploaded in the next batch. If unspecified messages will be eligible for upload immediately.
    * If both batchSize and batchIntervalMillis are specified, then messages will be eligible for upload when either condition is met.
    * The minimum value is 60000 milliseconds and the maximum is 9223372036854 milliseconds.
    * @param priority Priority for this upload stream. Lower values are higher priority. If not specified it will have the lowest priority.
    * @param startSequenceNumber The sequence number of the message to use as the starting message in the export.
    * Default is 0.
    * The sequence number provided should be less than the newest sequence number in the stream, i.e., sequence number of the last messaged appended.
    * To find the newest sequence number, describe the stream and then check the storage status of the returned MessageStreamInfo object.
    * @param disabled Enable or disable this export. Default is false.
