    * @param streamSegmentSize The size of each segment of the stream. Set to 16MB by default with a minimum of 1KB and a maximum of 2GB.
    * Data is only deleted segment by segment, so the segment size is the smallest amount of data which can be deleted.
    * @param timeToLiveMillis Time to live for each message in milliseconds. Data may be deleted at any time after the TTL expires; deletion is not guaranteed to occur immediately when the TTL expires.
    * The minimum value is 60000 milliseconds and the maximum is 9223372036854 milliseconds.
    * @param strategyOnFull What to do when the maximum size of the stream is reached.
    * RejectNewData: any append message request after the stream is full will be rejected with an exception.
    * OverwriteOldestData: the oldest stream segments will be deleted until there is room for the new message.
    * @param persistence Stream persistence. If set to File, the file system will be used to persist messages long-term and is resilient to restarts.
    * Memory should be used when performance matters more than durability as it only stores the stream in memory and never writes to the disk.
    * @param flushOnWrite This only applies when Persistence is set to File mode.
    * Waits for the filesystem to complete the write for every message. This is safer, but slower. Default is false.
    * @param exportDefinition Defines how and where the stream is uploaded. See the definition of the ExportDefinition object for more detail.
