/**
  * The **ShellFolderView** object fires two events, **EnumDone** and **SelectionChanged**, that are typically handled by applications. However, some applications
  * must handle events from a series of **ShellFolderView** objects. For example, an application might host a **WebBrowser** control that allows users to navigate through
  * a series of folders. Each folder has its own **ShellFolderView** object with its associated events. Handling these events can be difficult.
  *
  * The **ShellFolderViewOC** object simplifies event handling for such scenarios. It allows applications to handle events for all ShellFolderView objects with a single
  * pair of **ShellFolderViewOC** event handlers. Each time the user navigates to a new folder, the application passes the associated **ShellFolderView** object to the
  * **ShellFolderViewOC** object by calling **SetFolderView**. Then, when an **EnumDone** or **SelectionChanged** event is fired, the **ShellFolderViewOC** object
  * forwards the event to its own handler for processing.
