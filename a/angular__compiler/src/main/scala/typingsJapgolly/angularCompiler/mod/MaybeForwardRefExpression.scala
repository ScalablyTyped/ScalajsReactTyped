    * If this value is `ForwardRefHandling.None` then the `expression` is safe to use as-is.
    *
    * Otherwise the `expression` was wrapped in a call to `forwardRef()` and must not be eagerly
    * evaluated. Instead it must be wrapped in a function closure that will be evaluated lazily to
    * allow the definition of the expression to be evaluated first.
    *
    * In full AOT compilation it can be safe to unwrap the `forwardRef()` call up front if the
    * expression will actually be evaluated lazily inside a function call after the value of
    * `expression` has been defined.
    *
    * But in other cases, such as partial AOT compilation or JIT compilation the expression will be
    * evaluated eagerly in top level code so will need to continue to be wrapped in a `forwardRef()`
    * call.
