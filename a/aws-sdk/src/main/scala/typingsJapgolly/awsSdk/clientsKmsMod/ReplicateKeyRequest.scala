The key policy is not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can specify the same key policy or a different key policy for each key in a set of related multi-Region keys. KMS does not synchronize this property. If you provide a key policy, it must meet the following criteria:   If you don't set BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck to true, the key policy must give the caller kms:PutKeyPolicy permission on the replica key. This reduces the risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. For more information, refer to the scenario in the Default Key Policy section of the  Key Management Service Developer Guide .   Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be visible to KMS. When you create a new Amazon Web Services principal (for example, an IAM user or role), you might need to enforce a delay before including the new principal in a key policy because the new principal might not be immediately visible to KMS. For more information, see Changes that I make are not always immediately visible in the  Identity and Access Management User Guide .   A key policy document can include only the following characters:   Printable ASCII characters from the space character (\\u0020) through the end of the ASCII character range.   Printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through \\u00FF).   The tab (\\u0009), line feed (\\u000A), and carriage return (\\u000D) special characters   For information about key policies, see Key policies in KMS in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. For help writing and formatting a JSON policy document, see the IAM JSON Policy Reference in the  Identity and Access Management User Guide .

HMAC KMS keys are not supported in all Amazon Web Services Regions. If you try to replicate an HMAC KMS key in an Amazon Web Services Region in which HMAC keys are not supported, the ReplicateKey operation returns an UnsupportedOperationException.

KMS must be available in the replica Region. If the Region is not enabled by default, the Amazon Web Services account must be enabled in the Region.

    * Assigns one or more tags to the replica key. Use this parameter to tag the KMS key when it is created. To tag an existing KMS key, use the TagResource operation.  Tagging or untagging a KMS key can allow or deny permission to the KMS key. For details, see ABAC in KMS in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.  To use this parameter, you must have kms:TagResource permission in an IAM policy. Tags are not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can specify the same tags or different tags for each key in a set of related multi-Region keys. KMS does not synchronize this property. Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both the tag key and the tag value are required, but the tag value can be an empty (null) string. You cannot have more than one tag on a KMS key with the same tag key. If you specify an existing tag key with a different tag value, KMS replaces the current tag value with the specified one. When you add tags to an Amazon Web Services resource, Amazon Web Services generates a cost allocation report with usage and costs aggregated by tags. Tags can also be used to control access to a KMS key. For details, see Tagging Keys.
