    * The key policy to attach to the KMS key. The key policy must meet the following criteria:   If you don't set BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck to true, the key policy must allow the principal that is making the PutKeyPolicy request to make a subsequent PutKeyPolicy request on the KMS key. This reduces the risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. For more information, refer to the scenario in the Default Key Policy section of the Key Management Service Developer Guide.   Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be visible to KMS. When you create a new Amazon Web Services principal (for example, an IAM user or role), you might need to enforce a delay before including the new principal in a key policy because the new principal might not be immediately visible to KMS. For more information, see Changes that I make are not always immediately visible in the Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management User Guide.   A key policy document can include only the following characters:   Printable ASCII characters from the space character (\\u0020) through the end of the ASCII character range.   Printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through \\u00FF).   The tab (\\u0009), line feed (\\u000A), and carriage return (\\u000D) special characters   For information about key policies, see Key policies in KMS in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. For help writing and formatting a JSON policy document, see the IAM JSON Policy Reference in the  Identity and Access Management User Guide .
