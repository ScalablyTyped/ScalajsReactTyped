CREATE_IN_PROGRESS when an organization conformance pack creation is in progress.    CREATE_FAILED when an organization conformance pack creation failed in one or more member accounts within that organization.    DELETE_FAILED when an organization conformance pack deletion failed in one or more member accounts within that organization.    DELETE_IN_PROGRESS when an organization conformance pack deletion is in progress.    DELETE_SUCCESSFUL when an organization conformance pack has been successfully deleted from all the member accounts.    UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL when an organization conformance pack has been successfully updated in all the member accounts.    UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS when an organization conformance pack update is in progress.    UPDATE_FAILED when an organization conformance pack update failed in one or more member accounts within that organization.
