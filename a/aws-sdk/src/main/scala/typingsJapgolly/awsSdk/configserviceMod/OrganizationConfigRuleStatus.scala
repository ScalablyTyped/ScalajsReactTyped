CREATE_IN_PROGRESS when an organization config rule creation is in progress.    CREATE_FAILED when an organization config rule creation failed in one or more member accounts within that organization.

DELETE_IN_PROGRESS when an organization config rule deletion is in progress.    DELETE_SUCCESSFUL when an organization config rule has been successfully deleted from all the member accounts.    UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL when an organization config rule has been successfully updated in all the member accounts.    UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS when an organization config rule update is in progress.    UPDATE_FAILED when an organization config rule update failed in one or more member accounts within that organization.
