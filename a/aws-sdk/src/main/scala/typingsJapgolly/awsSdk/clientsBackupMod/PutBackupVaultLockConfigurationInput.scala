Backup enforces a 72-hour cooling-off period before Vault Lock takes effect and becomes immutable. Therefore, you must set ChangeableForDays to 3 or greater. Before the lock date, you can delete Vault Lock from the vault using DeleteBackupVaultLockConfiguration or change the Vault Lock configuration using PutBackupVaultLockConfiguration. On and after the lock date, the Vault Lock becomes immutable and cannot be changed or deleted. If this parameter is not specified, you can delete Vault Lock from the vault using DeleteBackupVaultLockConfiguration or change the Vault Lock configuration using PutBackupVaultLockConfiguration at any time.
