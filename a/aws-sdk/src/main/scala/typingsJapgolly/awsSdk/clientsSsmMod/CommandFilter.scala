    * The filter value. Valid values for each filter key are as follows:    InvokedAfter: Specify a timestamp to limit your results. For example, specify 2021-07-07T00:00:00Z to see a list of command executions occurring July 7, 2021, and later.    InvokedBefore: Specify a timestamp to limit your results. For example, specify 2021-07-07T00:00:00Z to see a list of command executions from before July 7, 2021.    Status: Specify a valid command status to see a list of all command executions with that status. The status choices depend on the API you call. The status values you can specify for ListCommands are:    Pending     InProgress     Success     Cancelled     Failed     TimedOut (this includes both Delivery and Execution time outs)     AccessDenied     DeliveryTimedOut     ExecutionTimedOut     Incomplete     NoInstancesInTag     LimitExceeded    The status values you can specify for ListCommandInvocations are:    Pending     InProgress     Delayed     Success     Cancelled     Failed     TimedOut (this includes both Delivery and Execution time outs)     AccessDenied     DeliveryTimedOut     ExecutionTimedOut     Undeliverable     InvalidPlatform     Terminated       DocumentName: Specify name of the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager document (SSM document) for which you want to see command execution results. For example, specify AWS-RunPatchBaseline to see command executions that used this SSM document to perform security patching operations on managed nodes.     ExecutionStage: Specify one of the following values (ListCommands operations only):    Executing: Returns a list of command executions that are currently still running.    Complete: Returns a list of command executions that have already completed.
