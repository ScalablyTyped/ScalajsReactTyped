    * A detailed status of the command execution for each invocation (each managed node targeted by the command). StatusDetails includes more information than Status because it includes states resulting from error and concurrency control parameters. StatusDetails can show different results than Status. For more information about these statuses, see Understanding command statuses in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. StatusDetails can be one of the following values:   Pending: The command hasn't been sent to the managed node.   In Progress: The command has been sent to the managed node but hasn't reached a terminal state.   Success: The execution of the command or plugin was successfully completed. This is a terminal state.   Delivery Timed Out: The command wasn't delivered to the managed node before the delivery timeout expired. Delivery timeouts don't count against the parent command's MaxErrors limit, but they do contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.   Execution Timed Out: Command execution started on the managed node, but the execution wasn't complete before the execution timeout expired. Execution timeouts count against the MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.   Failed: The command wasn't successful on the managed node. For a plugin, this indicates that the result code wasn't zero. For a command invocation, this indicates that the result code for one or more plugins wasn't zero. Invocation failures count against the MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.   Cancelled: The command was terminated before it was completed. This is a terminal state.   Undeliverable: The command can't be delivered to the managed node. The managed node might not exist or might not be responding. Undeliverable invocations don't count against the parent command's MaxErrors limit and don't contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.   Terminated: The parent command exceeded its MaxErrors limit and subsequent command invocations were canceled by the system. This is a terminal state.   Delayed: The system attempted to send the command to the managed node but wasn't successful. The system retries again.
