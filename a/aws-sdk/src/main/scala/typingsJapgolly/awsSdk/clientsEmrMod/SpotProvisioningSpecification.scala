The duration period starts as soon as a Spot Instance receives its instance ID. At the end of the duration, Amazon EC2 marks the Spot Instance for termination and provides a Spot Instance termination notice, which gives the instance a two-minute warning before it terminates.   Spot Instances with a defined duration (also known as Spot blocks) are no longer available to new customers from July 1, 2021. For customers who have previously used the feature, we will continue to support Spot Instances with a defined duration until December 31, 2022.
