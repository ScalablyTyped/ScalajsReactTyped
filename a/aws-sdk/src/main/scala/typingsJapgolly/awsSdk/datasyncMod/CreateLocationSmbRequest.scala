The SMB path should be a path that's exported by the SMB server, or a subdirectory of that path. The path should be such that it can be mounted by other SMB clients in your network.   Subdirectory must be specified with forward slashes. For example /path/to/folder.  To transfer all the data in the folder you specified, DataSync needs to have permissions to mount the SMB share, as well as to access all the data in that share. To ensure this, either ensure that the user/password specified belongs to the user who can mount the share, and who has the appropriate permissions for all of the files and directories that you want DataSync to access, or use credentials of a member of the Backup Operators group to mount the share. Doing either enables the agent to access the data. For the agent to access directories, you must additionally enable all execute access.
