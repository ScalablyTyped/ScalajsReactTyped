    * The Amazon S3 location of the most recent custom terminology input file that was successfully imported into Amazon Translate. The location is returned as a presigned URL that has a 30-minute expiration .  Amazon Translate doesn't scan all input files for the risk of CSV injection attacks.  CSV injection occurs when a .csv or .tsv file is altered so that a record contains malicious code. The record begins with a special character, such as =, +, -, or @. When the file is opened in a spreadsheet program, the program might interpret the record as a formula and run the code within it. Before you download an input file from Amazon S3, ensure that you recognize the file and trust its creator.
