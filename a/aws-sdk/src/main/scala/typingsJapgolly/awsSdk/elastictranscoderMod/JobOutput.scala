    * You can configure Elastic Transcoder to transcode captions, or subtitles, from one format to another. All captions must be in UTF-8. Elastic Transcoder supports two types of captions:    Embedded: Embedded captions are included in the same file as the audio and video. Elastic Transcoder supports only one embedded caption per language, to a maximum of 300 embedded captions per file. Valid input values include: CEA-608 (EIA-608, first non-empty channel only), CEA-708 (EIA-708, first non-empty channel only), and mov-text  Valid outputs include: mov-text  Elastic Transcoder supports a maximum of one embedded format per output.    Sidecar: Sidecar captions are kept in a separate metadata file from the audio and video data. Sidecar captions require a player that is capable of understanding the relationship between the video file and the sidecar file. Elastic Transcoder supports only one sidecar caption per language, to a maximum of 20 sidecar captions per file. Valid input values include: dfxp (first div element only), ebu-tt, scc, smpt, srt, ttml (first div element only), and webvtt  Valid outputs include: dfxp (first div element only), scc, srt, and webvtt.   If you want ttml or smpte-tt compatible captions, specify dfxp as your output format. Elastic Transcoder does not support OCR (Optical Character Recognition), does not accept pictures as a valid input for captions, and is not available for audio-only transcoding. Elastic Transcoder does not preserve text formatting (for example, italics) during the transcoding process. To remove captions or leave the captions empty, set Captions to null. To pass through existing captions unchanged, set the MergePolicy to MergeRetain, and pass in a null CaptionSources array. For more information on embedded files, see the Subtitles Wikipedia page. For more information on sidecar files, see the Extensible Metadata Platform and Sidecar file Wikipedia pages.

Each segment is approximately the length of the SegmentDuration, though individual segments might be shorter or longer. The range of valid values is 1 to 60 seconds. If the duration of the video is not evenly divisible by SegmentDuration, the duration of the last segment is the remainder of total length/SegmentDuration.

You can specify the following values in any sequence:     {count} (Required): If you want to create thumbnails, you must include {count} in the ThumbnailPattern object. Wherever you specify {count}, Elastic Transcoder adds a five-digit sequence number (beginning with 00001) to thumbnail file names. The number indicates where a given thumbnail appears in the sequence of thumbnails for a transcoded file.   If you specify a literal value and/or {resolution} but you omit {count}, Elastic Transcoder returns a validation error and does not create the job.

For example, you can include them as a file name prefix or as a delimiter between {resolution} and {count}.      {resolution} (Optional): If you want Elastic Transcoder to include the resolution in the file name, include {resolution} in the ThumbnailPattern object.
