This prevents previous actions with lower number IDs from possibly overriding the latest action. The ordering ID can be the UNIX time of the last update you made to a group members list. You would then provide this list when calling PutPrincipalMapping. This ensures your PUT action for that updated group with the latest members list doesn't get overwritten by earlier PUT actions for the same group which are yet to be processed. The default ordering ID is the current UNIX time in milliseconds that the action was received by Amazon Kendra.
