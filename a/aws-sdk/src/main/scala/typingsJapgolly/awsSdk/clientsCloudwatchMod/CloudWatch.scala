In the event of an error, no alarms are deleted.  It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B also depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can't delete any composite alarm that is part of the cycle because there is always still a composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to delete. To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the rule of one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency that creates the cycle. The simplest change to make to break a cycle is to change the AlarmRule of one of the alarms to False.

You can also optionally perform metric math expressions on the values of the returned statistics, to create new time series that represent new insights into your data. For example, using Lambda metrics, you could divide the Errors metric by the Invocations metric to get an error rate time series. For more information about metric math expressions, see Metric Math Syntax and Functions in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide. If you include a Metrics Insights query, each GetMetricData operation can include only one query. But the same GetMetricData operation can also retrieve other metrics. Metrics Insights queries can query only the most recent three hours of metric data. For more information about Metrics Insights, see Query your metrics with CloudWatch Metrics Insights. Calls to the GetMetricData API have a different pricing structure than calls to GetMetricStatistics. For more information about pricing, see Amazon CloudWatch Pricing. Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:   Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a StorageResolution of 1.   Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15 days.   Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63 days.   Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months).   Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour. If you omit Unit in your request, all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.  Using Metrics Insights queries with metric math  You can't mix a Metric Insights query and metric math syntax in the same expression, but you can reference results from a Metrics Insights query within other Metric math expressions. A Metrics Insights query without a GROUP BY clause returns a single time-series (TS), and can be used as input for a metric math expression that expects a single time series.

To reduce the number of data points, you can narrow the specified time range and make multiple requests across adjacent time ranges, or you can increase the specified period. Data points are not returned in chronological order. CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period that you specify. For example, if you request statistics with a one-hour period, CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time stamps that fall within each one-hour period. Therefore, the number of values aggregated by CloudWatch is larger than the number of data points returned. CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:   The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1.   The Min and the Max values of the statistic set are equal.   Percentile statistics are not available for metrics when any of the metric values are negative numbers.

Data points are not returned in chronological order. CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period that you specify. For example, if you request statistics with a one-hour period, CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time stamps that fall within each one-hour period. Therefore, the number of values aggregated by CloudWatch is larger than the number of data points returned. CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:   The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1.   The Min and the Max values of the statistic set are equal.   Percentile statistics are not available for metrics when any of the metric values are negative numbers. Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:   Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a StorageResolution of 1.   Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15 days.   Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63 days.   Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months).   Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour. CloudWatch started retaining 5-minute and 1-hour metric data as of July 9, 2016. For information about metrics and dimensions supported by Amazon Web Services services, see the Amazon CloudWatch Metrics and Dimensions Reference in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.

It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B also depends on composite alarm A.

If you publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:   The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1 and Min, Max, and Sum are all equal.   The Min and Max are equal, and Sum is equal to Min multiplied by SampleCount.

    * Creates or updates a metric stream. Metric streams can automatically stream CloudWatch metrics to Amazon Web Services destinations including Amazon S3 and to many third-party solutions. For more information, see  Using Metric Streams. To create a metric stream, you must be logged on to an account that has the iam:PassRole permission and either the CloudWatchFullAccess policy or the cloudwatch:PutMetricStream permission. When you create or update a metric stream, you choose one of the following:   Stream metrics from all metric namespaces in the account.   Stream metrics from all metric namespaces in the account, except for the namespaces that you list in ExcludeFilters.   Stream metrics from only the metric namespaces that you list in IncludeFilters.   By default, a metric stream always sends the MAX, MIN, SUM, and SAMPLECOUNT statistics for each metric that is streamed. You can use the StatisticsConfigurations parameter to have the metric stream also send additional statistics in the stream. Streaming additional statistics incurs additional costs. For more information, see Amazon CloudWatch Pricing.  When you use PutMetricStream to create a new metric stream, the stream is created in the running state. If you use it to update an existing stream, the state of the stream is not changed.
