Overprovisioned —An instance is considered over-provisioned when at least one specification of your instance, such as CPU, memory, or network, can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload, and no specification is under-provisioned. Over-provisioned instances may lead to unnecessary infrastructure cost.

  /**
    * The reason for the finding classification of the instance. Finding reason codes for instances include:     CPUOverprovisioned  — The instance’s CPU configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload. This is identified by analyzing the CPUUtilization metric of the current instance during the look-back period.     CPUUnderprovisioned  — The instance’s CPU configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better CPU performance. This is identified by analyzing the CPUUtilization metric of the current instance during the look-back period.     MemoryOverprovisioned  — The instance’s memory configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload. This is identified by analyzing the memory utilization metric of the current instance during the look-back period.     MemoryUnderprovisioned  — The instance’s memory configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better memory performance. This is identified by analyzing the memory utilization metric of the current instance during the look-back period.  Memory utilization is analyzed only for resources that have the unified CloudWatch agent installed on them. For more information, see Enabling memory utilization with the Amazon CloudWatch Agent in the Compute Optimizer User Guide. On Linux instances, Compute Optimizer analyses the mem_used_percent metric in the CWAgent namespace, or the legacy MemoryUtilization metric in the System/Linux namespace. On Windows instances, Compute Optimizer analyses the Memory % Committed Bytes In Use metric in the CWAgent namespace.      EBSThroughputOverprovisioned  — The instance’s EBS throughput configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload. This is identified by analyzing the VolumeReadOps and VolumeWriteOps metrics of EBS volumes attached to the current instance during the look-back period.     EBSThroughputUnderprovisioned  — The instance’s EBS throughput configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better EBS throughput performance. This is identified by analyzing the VolumeReadOps and VolumeWriteOps metrics of EBS volumes attached to the current instance during the look-back period.     EBSIOPSOverprovisioned  — The instance’s EBS IOPS configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload. This is identified by analyzing the VolumeReadBytes and VolumeWriteBytes metric of EBS volumes attached to the current instance during the look-back period.     EBSIOPSUnderprovisioned  — The instance’s EBS IOPS configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better EBS IOPS performance. This is identified by analyzing the VolumeReadBytes and VolumeWriteBytes metric of EBS volumes attached to the current instance during the look-back period.     NetworkBandwidthOverprovisioned  — The instance’s network bandwidth configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload. This is identified by analyzing the NetworkIn and NetworkOut metrics of the current instance during the look-back period.     NetworkBandwidthUnderprovisioned  — The instance’s network bandwidth configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better network bandwidth performance. This is identified by analyzing the NetworkIn and NetworkOut metrics of the current instance during the look-back period. This finding reason happens when the NetworkIn or NetworkOut performance of an instance is impacted.     NetworkPPSOverprovisioned  — The instance’s network PPS (packets per second) configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload. This is identified by analyzing the NetworkPacketsIn and NetworkPacketsIn metrics of the current instance during the look-back period.     NetworkPPSUnderprovisioned  — The instance’s network PPS (packets per second) configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better network PPS performance. This is identified by analyzing the NetworkPacketsIn and NetworkPacketsIn metrics of the current instance during the look-back period.     DiskIOPSOverprovisioned  — The instance’s disk IOPS configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload. This is identified by analyzing the DiskReadOps and DiskWriteOps metrics of the current instance during the look-back period.     DiskIOPSUnderprovisioned  — The instance’s disk IOPS configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better disk IOPS performance. This is identified by analyzing the DiskReadOps and DiskWriteOps metrics of the current instance during the look-back period.     DiskThroughputOverprovisioned  — The instance’s disk throughput configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload. This is identified by analyzing the DiskReadBytes and DiskWriteBytes metrics of the current instance during the look-back period.     DiskThroughputUnderprovisioned  — The instance’s disk throughput configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better disk throughput performance. This is identified by analyzing the DiskReadBytes and DiskWriteBytes metrics of the current instance during the look-back period.    For more information about instance metrics, see List the available CloudWatch metrics for your instances in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. For more information about EBS volume metrics, see Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Amazon EBS in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
