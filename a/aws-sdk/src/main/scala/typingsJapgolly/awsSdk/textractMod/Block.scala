    * The type of text item that's recognized. In operations for text detection, the following types are returned:    PAGE - Contains a list of the LINE Block objects that are detected on a document page.    WORD - A word detected on a document page. A word is one or more ISO basic Latin script characters that aren't separated by spaces.    LINE - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that are detected on a document page.   In text analysis operations, the following types are returned:    PAGE - Contains a list of child Block objects that are detected on a document page.    KEY_VALUE_SET - Stores the KEY and VALUE Block objects for linked text that's detected on a document page. Use the EntityType field to determine if a KEY_VALUE_SET object is a KEY Block object or a VALUE Block object.     WORD - A word that's detected on a document page. A word is one or more ISO basic Latin script characters that aren't separated by spaces.    LINE - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that are detected on a document page.    TABLE - A table that's detected on a document page. A table is grid-based information with two or more rows or columns, with a cell span of one row and one column each.     CELL - A cell within a detected table. The cell is the parent of the block that contains the text in the cell.    SELECTION_ELEMENT - A selection element such as an option button (radio button) or a check box that's detected on a document page. Use the value of SelectionStatus to determine the status of the selection element.
