    * (Optional) Specifies that the secret is to be deleted without any recovery window. You can't use both this parameter and the RecoveryWindowInDays parameter in the same API call. An asynchronous background process performs the actual deletion, so there can be a short delay before the operation completes. If you write code to delete and then immediately recreate a secret with the same name, ensure that your code includes appropriate back off and retry logic.  Use this parameter with caution. This parameter causes the operation to skip the normal waiting period before the permanent deletion that AWS would normally impose with the RecoveryWindowInDays parameter. If you delete a secret with the ForceDeleteWithouRecovery parameter, then you have no opportunity to recover the secret. It is permanently lost.

  /**
    * Specifies the secret that you want to delete. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.  If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names that end with a hyphen followed by six characters.
