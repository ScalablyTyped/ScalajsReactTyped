DONT_KNOW  The TLD registry didn't reply with a definitive answer about whether the domain name is available. Route 53 can return this response for a variety of reasons, for example, the registry is performing maintenance. Try again later.  PENDING  The TLD registry didn't return a response in the expected amount of time. When the response is delayed, it usually takes just a few extra seconds. You can resubmit the request immediately.  RESERVED  The domain name has been reserved for another person or organization.  UNAVAILABLE  The domain name is not available.  UNAVAILABLE_PREMIUM  The domain name is not available.  UNAVAILABLE_RESTRICTED  The domain name is forbidden.
