    * Represents a list of URIs of a location. LocationUri returns an array that contains a list of locations when the ListLocations operation is called. Format: TYPE://GLOBAL_ID/SUBDIR. TYPE designates the type of location (for example, nfs or s3). GLOBAL_ID is the globally unique identifier of the resource that backs the location. An example for EFS is us-east-2.fs-abcd1234. An example for Amazon S3 is the bucket name, such as myBucket. An example for NFS is a valid IPv4 address or a hostname that is compliant with Domain Name Service (DNS). SUBDIR is a valid file system path, delimited by forward slashes as is the *nix convention. For NFS and Amazon EFS, it's the export path to mount the location. For Amazon S3, it's the prefix path that you mount to and treat as the root of the location.
