CloudFormation proceeds with the stack set operation in this account and Region.   The AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole of the stack set administration account lacks permissions to invoke the function. CloudFormation proceeds with the stack set operation in this account and Region.   Either no action is necessary, or no action is possible, on the stack.
