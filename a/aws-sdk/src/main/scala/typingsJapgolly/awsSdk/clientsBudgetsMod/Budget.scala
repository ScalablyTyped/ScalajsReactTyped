For monthly budgets, provide 12 months of PlannedBudgetLimits values. This must start from the current month and include the next 11 months. The key is the start of the month, UTC in epoch seconds.  For quarterly budgets, provide four quarters of PlannedBudgetLimits value entries in standard calendar quarter increments. This must start from the current quarter and include the next three quarters. The key is the start of the quarter, UTC in epoch seconds.  If the planned budget expires before 12 months for monthly or four quarters for quarterly, provide the PlannedBudgetLimits values only for the remaining periods. If the budget begins at a date in the future, provide PlannedBudgetLimits values from the start date of the budget.  After all of the BudgetLimit values in PlannedBudgetLimits are used, the budget continues to use the last limit as the BudgetLimit. At that point, the planned budget provides the same experience as a fixed budget.   DescribeBudget and DescribeBudgets response along with PlannedBudgetLimits also contain BudgetLimit representing the current month or quarter limit present in PlannedBudgetLimits.

If you create your budget and don't specify a start date, Amazon Web Services defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose DAILY, and didn't set a start date, Amazon Web Services set your start date to 01/24/18 00:00 UTC. If you chose MONTHLY, Amazon Web Services set your start date to 01/01/18 00:00 UTC. If you didn't specify an end date, Amazon Web Services set your end date to 06/15/87 00:00 UTC. The defaults are the same for the Billing and Cost Management console and the API.  You can change either date with the UpdateBudget operation. After the end date, Amazon Web Services deletes the budget and all the associated notifications and subscribers.
