However, for CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM. The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see IAM and STS character quotas. To learn more about JSON policy grammar, see Grammar of the IAM JSON policy language in the IAM User Guide.  The regex pattern used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:   Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (\\u0020) through the end of the ASCII character range   The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through \\u00FF)   The special characters tab (\\u0009), line feed (\\u000A), and carriage return (\\u000D)
