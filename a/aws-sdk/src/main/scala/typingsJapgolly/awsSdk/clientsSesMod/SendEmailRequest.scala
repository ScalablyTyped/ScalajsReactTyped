For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide.  Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described in RFC6531. For this reason, the local part of a source email address (the part of the email address that precedes the @ sign) may only contain 7-bit ASCII characters. If the domain part of an address (the part after the @ sign) contains non-ASCII characters, they must be encoded using Punycode, as described in RFC3492. The sender name (also known as the friendly name) may contain non-ASCII characters. These characters must be encoded using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in RFC 2047. MIME encoded-word syntax uses the following form: =?charset?encoding?encoded-text?=.
