    use, your new tag overwrites the existing key-value pair. 
    
    
    You can't start a tag key with aws: because this prefix is reserved for use
    by  AWS.  AWS creates tags that begin with this prefix on your behalf, but
    you can't edit or delete them.
    
    
    Tag keys must be between 1 and 128 Unicode characters in length.
    
    
    Tag keys must consist of the following characters: Unicode letters, digits,
    white space, and the following special characters: _ . / = + -
    @.
