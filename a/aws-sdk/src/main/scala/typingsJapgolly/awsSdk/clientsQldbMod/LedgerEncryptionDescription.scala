    * The current state of encryption at rest for the ledger. This can be one of the following values:    ENABLED: Encryption is fully enabled using the specified key.    UPDATING: The ledger is actively processing the specified key change. Key changes in QLDB are asynchronous. The ledger is fully accessible without any performance impact while the key change is being processed. The amount of time it takes to update a key varies depending on the ledger size.    KMS_KEY_INACCESSIBLE: The specified customer managed KMS key is not accessible, and the ledger is impaired. Either the key was disabled or deleted, or the grants on the key were revoked. When a ledger is impaired, it is not accessible and does not accept any read or write requests. An impaired ledger automatically returns to an active state after you restore the grants on the key, or re-enable the key that was disabled. However, deleting a customer managed KMS key is irreversible. After a key is deleted, you can no longer access the ledgers that are protected with that key, and the data becomes unrecoverable permanently.
