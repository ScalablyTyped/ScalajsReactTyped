The options are as follows:    ALL_REGIONS - Indicates to aggregate findings from all of the Regions where Security Hub is enabled. When you choose this option, Security Hub also automatically aggregates findings from new Regions as Security Hub supports them and you opt into them.     ALL_REGIONS_EXCEPT_SPECIFIED - Indicates to aggregate findings from all of the Regions where Security Hub is enabled, except for the Regions listed in the Regions parameter. When you choose this option, Security Hub also automatically aggregates findings from new Regions as Security Hub supports them and you opt into them.     SPECIFIED_REGIONS - Indicates to aggregate findings only from the Regions listed in the Regions parameter. Security Hub does not automatically aggregate findings from new Regions.
