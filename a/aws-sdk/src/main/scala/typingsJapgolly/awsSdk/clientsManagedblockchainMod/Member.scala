Either the AWS account that owns the member deleted it, or the member is being deleted as the result of an APPROVED PROPOSAL to remove the member.    DELETED - The member can no longer participate on the network and all associated resources are deleted. Either the AWS account that owns the member deleted it, or the member is being deleted as the result of an APPROVED PROPOSAL to remove the member.    INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_KEY - The member is impaired and might not function as expected because it cannot access the specified customer managed key in AWS KMS for encryption at rest. Either the KMS key was disabled or deleted, or the grants on the key were revoked. The effect of disabling or deleting a key, or revoking a grant is not immediate.
