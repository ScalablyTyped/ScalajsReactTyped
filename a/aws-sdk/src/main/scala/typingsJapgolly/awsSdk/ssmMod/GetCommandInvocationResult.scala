StatusDetails includes more information than Status because it includes states resulting from error and concurrency control parameters. StatusDetails can show different results than Status. For more information about these statuses, see Understanding Command Statuses in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide. StatusDetails can be one of the following values:   Pending: The command has not been sent to the instance.   In Progress: The command has been sent to the instance but has not reached a terminal state.   Delayed: The system attempted to send the command to the target, but the target was not available. The instance might not be available because of network issues, the instance was stopped, etc. The system will try to deliver the command again.   Success: The command or plugin was run successfully. This is a terminal state.   Delivery Timed Out: The command was not delivered to the instance before the delivery timeout expired. Delivery timeouts do not count against the parent command's MaxErrors limit, but they do contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.   Execution Timed Out: The command started to run on the instance, but the execution was not complete before the timeout expired. Execution timeouts count against the MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.   Failed: The command wasn't run successfully on the instance. For a plugin, this indicates that the result code was not zero. For a command invocation, this indicates that the result code for one or more plugins was not zero. Invocation failures count against the MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.   Canceled: The command was terminated before it was completed. This is a terminal state.   Undeliverable: The command can't be delivered to the instance. The instance might not exist or might not be responding. Undeliverable invocations don't count against the parent command's MaxErrors limit and don't contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.   Terminated: The parent command exceeded its MaxErrors limit and subsequent command invocations were canceled by the system. This is a terminal state.
