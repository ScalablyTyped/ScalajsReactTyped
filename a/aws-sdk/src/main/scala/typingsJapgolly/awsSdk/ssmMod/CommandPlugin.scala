    * A detailed status of the plugin execution. StatusDetails includes more information than Status because it includes states resulting from error and concurrency control parameters.

StatusDetails can be one of the following values:   Pending: The command has not been sent to the instance.   In Progress: The command has been sent to the instance but has not reached a terminal state.   Success: The execution of the command or plugin was successfully completed. This is a terminal state.   Delivery Timed Out: The command was not delivered to the instance before the delivery timeout expired. Delivery timeouts do not count against the parent command's MaxErrors limit, but they do contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.   Execution Timed Out: Command execution started on the instance, but the execution was not complete before the execution timeout expired. Execution timeouts count against the MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.   Failed: The command was not successful on the instance. For a plugin, this indicates that the result code was not zero. For a command invocation, this indicates that the result code for one or more plugins was not zero. Invocation failures count against the MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.   Canceled: The command was terminated before it was completed. This is a terminal state.   Undeliverable: The command can't be delivered to the instance. The instance might not exist, or it might not be responding. Undeliverable invocations don't count against the parent command's MaxErrors limit, and they don't contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.   Terminated: The parent command exceeded its MaxErrors limit and subsequent command invocations were canceled by the system. This is a terminal state.
