Information about the unindexed faces is available in the UnindexedFaces array.

If you specify LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH, filtering removes all faces that donâ€™t meet the chosen quality bar. The default value is AUTO. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Low-quality detections can occur for a number of reasons. Some examples are an object that's misidentified as a face, a face that's too blurry, or a face with a pose that's too extreme to use. If you specify NONE, no filtering is performed.  To use quality filtering, the collection you are using must be associated with version 3 of the face model or higher.
