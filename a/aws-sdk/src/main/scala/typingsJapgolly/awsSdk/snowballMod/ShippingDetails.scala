This speed represents how quickly it moves to its destination while in transit. Regional shipping speeds are as follows:   In Australia, you have access to express shipping. Typically, Snowballs shipped express are delivered in about a day.   In the European Union (EU), you have access to express shipping. Typically, Snowballs shipped express are delivered in about a day. In addition, most countries in the EU have access to standard shipping, which typically takes less than a week, one way.   In India, Snowballs are delivered in one to seven days.   In the United States of America (US), you have access to one-day shipping and two-day shipping.
