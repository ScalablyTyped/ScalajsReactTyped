  /**
    * Specifies whether Amazon Cognito uses its built-in functionality to send your users email messages, or uses your Amazon Simple Email Service email configuration. Specify one of the following values:  COGNITO_DEFAULT  When Amazon Cognito emails your users, it uses its built-in email functionality. When you use the default option, Amazon Cognito allows only a limited number of emails each day for your user pool. For typical production environments, the default email limit is less than the required delivery volume. To achieve a higher delivery volume, specify DEVELOPER to use your Amazon SES email configuration. To look up the email delivery limit for the default option, see Limits in  in the  Developer Guide. The default FROM address is no-reply@verificationemail.com. To customize the FROM address, provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon SES verified email address for the SourceArn parameter.  DEVELOPER  When Amazon Cognito emails your users, it uses your Amazon SES configuration. Amazon Cognito calls Amazon SES on your behalf to send email from your verified email address. When you use this option, the email delivery limits are the same limits that apply to your Amazon SES verified email address in your Amazon Web Services account. If you use this option, provide the ARN of an Amazon SES verified email address for the SourceArn parameter. Before Amazon Cognito can email your users, it requires additional permissions to call Amazon SES on your behalf. When you update your user pool with this option, Amazon Cognito creates a service-linked role, which is a type of role, in your Amazon Web Services account. This role contains the permissions that allow to access Amazon SES and send email messages with your address. For more information about the service-linked role that Amazon Cognito creates, see Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon Cognito in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide.

If you specify DEVELOPER, Amazon Cognito emails your users with this address by calling Amazon SES on your behalf.
