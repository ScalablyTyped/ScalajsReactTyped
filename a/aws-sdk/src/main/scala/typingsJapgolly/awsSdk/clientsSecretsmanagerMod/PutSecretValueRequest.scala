    * A unique identifier for the new version of the secret.   If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty because they generate a random UUID for you. If you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ClientRequestToken yourself for new versions and include that value in the request.   This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during the Lambda rotation function processing. We recommend that you generate a UUID-type value to ensure uniqueness within the specified secret.    If the ClientRequestToken value isn't already associated with a version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.    If a version with this value already exists and that version's SecretString or SecretBinary values are the same as those in the request then the request is ignored. The operation is idempotent.    If a version with this value already exists and the version of the SecretString and SecretBinary values are different from those in the request, then the request fails because you can't modify a secret version. You can only create new versions to store new secret values.   This value becomes the VersionId of the new version.

If you specify AWSCURRENT, and it is already attached to another version, then Secrets Manager also moves the staging label AWSPREVIOUS to the version that AWSCURRENT was removed from. If you don't include VersionStages, then Secrets Manager automatically moves the staging label AWSCURRENT to this version.
