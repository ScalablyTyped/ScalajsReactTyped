    * A cron() or rate() expression that defines the schedule for rotating your secret. Secrets Manager rotation schedules use UTC time zone.  Secrets Manager rate() expressions represent the interval in days that you want to rotate your secret, for example rate(10 days). If you use a rate() expression, the rotation window opens at midnight, and Secrets Manager rotates your secret any time that day after midnight. You can set a Duration to shorten the rotation window. You can use a cron() expression to create rotation schedules that are more detailed than a rotation interval. For more information, including examples, see Schedule expressions in Secrets Manager rotation. If you use a cron() expression, Secrets Manager rotates your secret any time during that day after the window opens. For example, cron(0 8 1 * ? *) represents a rotation window that occurs on the first day of every month beginning at 8:00 AM UTC. Secrets Manager rotates the secret any time that day after 8:00 AM. You can set a Duration to shorten the rotation window.
