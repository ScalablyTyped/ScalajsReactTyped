    * The DKIM authentication status of the identity. Amazon SES determines the authentication status by searching for specific records in the DNS configuration for your domain. If you used Easy DKIM to set up DKIM authentication, Amazon SES tries to find three unique CNAME records in the DNS configuration for your domain. If you provided a public key to perform DKIM authentication, Amazon SES tries to find a TXT record that uses the selector that you specified. The value of the TXT record must be a public key that's paired with the private key that you specified in the process of creating the identity. The status can be one of the following:    PENDING – The verification process was initiated, but Amazon SES hasn't yet detected the DKIM records in the DNS configuration for the domain.    SUCCESS – The verification process completed successfully.    FAILED – The verification process failed. This typically occurs when Amazon SES fails to find the DKIM records in the DNS configuration of the domain.    TEMPORARY_FAILURE – A temporary issue is preventing Amazon SES from determining the DKIM authentication status of the domain.    NOT_STARTED – The DKIM verification process hasn't been initiated for the domain.
