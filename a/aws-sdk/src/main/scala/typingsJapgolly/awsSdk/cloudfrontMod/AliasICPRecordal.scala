Multiple CNAMEs can be associated with a distribution, and CNAMEs can correspond to different ICP recordals. To be marked as APPROVED, that is, valid to use with China region, a CNAME must have one ICP recordal number associated with it.

PENDING indicates that CloudFront can't determine the ICP recordal status of the CNAME associated with the distribution because there was an error in trying to determine the status. You can try again to see if the error is resolved in which case CloudFront returns an APPROVED or SUSPENDED status.
