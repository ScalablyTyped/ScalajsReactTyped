The maximum value is 20,000 epochs. All metrics that correspond to an objective metric are used to derive early stopping decisions. For distributive training jobs, ensure that duplicate metrics are not printed in the logs across the individual nodes in a training job. If multiple nodes are publishing duplicate or incorrect metrics, training jobs may make an incorrect stopping decision and stop the job prematurely.
