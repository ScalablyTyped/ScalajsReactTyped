The name of the Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group must begin with the /aws/fsx prefix. The name of the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehouse delivery stream must begin with the aws-fsx prefix.   If you do not provide a destination in AuditLogDestination, Amazon FSx will create and use a log stream in the CloudWatch Logs /aws/fsx/windows log group.
