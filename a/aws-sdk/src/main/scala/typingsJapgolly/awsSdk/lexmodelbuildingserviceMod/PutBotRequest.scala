    * When Amazon Lex can't understand the user's input in context, it tries to elicit the information a few times. After that, Amazon Lex sends the message defined in abortStatement to the user, and then aborts the conversation. To set the number of retries, use the valueElicitationPrompt field for the slot type.  For example, in a pizza ordering bot, Amazon Lex might ask a user "What type of crust would you like?" If the user's response is not one of the expected responses (for example, "thin crust, "deep dish," etc.), Amazon Lex tries to elicit a correct response a few more times.  For example, in a pizza ordering application, OrderPizza might be one of the intents. This intent might require the CrustType slot. You specify the valueElicitationPrompt field when you create the CrustType slot. If you have defined a fallback intent the abort statement will not be sent to the user, the fallback intent is used instead. For more information, see  AMAZON.FallbackIntent.

By specifying true in the childDirected field, you confirm that your use of Amazon Lex is related to a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA. By specifying false in the childDirected field, you confirm that your use of Amazon Lex is not related to a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA. You may not specify a default value for the childDirected field that does not accurately reflect whether your use of Amazon Lex is related to a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA.

  /**
    * When Amazon Lex doesn't understand the user's intent, it uses this message to get clarification. To specify how many times Amazon Lex should repeat the clarification prompt, use the maxAttempts field. If Amazon Lex still doesn't understand, it sends the message in the abortStatement field.  When you create a clarification prompt, make sure that it suggests the correct response from the user. for example, for a bot that orders pizza and drinks, you might create this clarification prompt: "What would you like to do? You can say 'Order a pizza' or 'Order a drink.'" If you have defined a fallback intent, it will be invoked if the clarification prompt is repeated the number of times defined in the maxAttempts field. For more information, see  AMAZON.FallbackIntent. If you don't define a clarification prompt, at runtime Amazon Lex will return a 400 Bad Request exception in three cases:    Follow-up prompt - When the user responds to a follow-up prompt but does not provide an intent. For example, in response to a follow-up prompt that says "Would you like anything else today?" the user says "Yes." Amazon Lex will return a 400 Bad Request exception because it does not have a clarification prompt to send to the user to get an intent.   Lambda function - When using a Lambda function, you return an ElicitIntent dialog type. Since Amazon Lex does not have a clarification prompt to get an intent from the user, it returns a 400 Bad Request exception.   PutSession operation - When using the PutSession operation, you send an ElicitIntent dialog type. Since Amazon Lex does not have a clarification prompt to get an intent from the user, it returns a 400 Bad Request exception.

If the user doesn't complete the order within the specified time, Amazon Lex discards the slot information that it gathered, and the user must start over.
