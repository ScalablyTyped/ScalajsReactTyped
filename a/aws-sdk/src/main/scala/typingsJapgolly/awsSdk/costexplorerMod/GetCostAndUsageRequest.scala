Valid values are AmortizedCost, BlendedCost, NetAmortizedCost, NetUnblendedCost, NormalizedUsageAmount, UnblendedCost, and UsageQuantity.   If you return the UsageQuantity metric, the service aggregates all usage numbers without taking into account the units. For example, if you aggregate usageQuantity across all of Amazon EC2, the results aren't meaningful because Amazon EC2 compute hours and data transfer are measured in different units (for example, hours vs. GB). To get more meaningful UsageQuantity metrics, filter by UsageType or UsageTypeGroups.    Metrics is required for GetCostAndUsage requests.
