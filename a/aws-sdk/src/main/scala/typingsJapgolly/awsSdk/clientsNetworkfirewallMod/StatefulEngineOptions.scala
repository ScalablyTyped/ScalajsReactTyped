  /**
    * Configures how Network Firewall processes traffic when a network connection breaks midstream. Network connections can break due to disruptions in external networks or within the firewall itself.    DROP - Network Firewall fails closed and drops all subsequent traffic going to the firewall. This is the default behavior.    CONTINUE - Network Firewall continues to apply rules to the subsequent traffic without context from traffic before the break. This impacts the behavior of rules that depend on this context. For example, if you have a stateful rule to drop http traffic, Network Firewall won't match the traffic for this rule because the service won't have the context from session initialization defining the application layer protocol as HTTP. However, this behavior is rule dependentâ€”a TCP-layer rule using a flow:stateless rule would still match, as would the aws:drop_strict default action.
