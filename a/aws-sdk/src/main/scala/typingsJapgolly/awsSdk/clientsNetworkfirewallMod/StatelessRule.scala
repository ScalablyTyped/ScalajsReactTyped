    * Indicates the order in which to run this rule relative to all of the rules that are defined for a stateless rule group. Network Firewall evaluates the rules in a rule group starting with the lowest priority setting. You must ensure that the priority settings are unique for the rule group.  Each stateless rule group uses exactly one StatelessRulesAndCustomActions object, and each StatelessRulesAndCustomActions contains exactly one StatelessRules object. To ensure unique priority settings for your rule groups, set unique priorities for the stateless rules that you define inside any single StatelessRules object. You can change the priority settings of your rules at any time. To make it easier to insert rules later, number them so there's a wide range in between, for example use 100, 200, and so on.
