    * The strategy that determines how to allocate the target Spot Instance capacity across the Spot Instance pools specified by the EC2 Fleet launch configuration. For more information, see Allocation strategies for Spot Instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.  lowest-price - EC2 Fleet launches instances from the lowest-price Spot Instance pool that has available capacity. If the cheapest pool doesn't have available capacity, the Spot Instances come from the next cheapest pool that has available capacity. If a pool runs out of capacity before fulfilling your desired capacity, EC2 Fleet will continue to fulfill your request by drawing from the next cheapest pool. To ensure that your desired capacity is met, you might receive Spot Instances from several pools.  diversified - EC2 Fleet launches instances from all of the Spot Instance pools that you specify.  capacity-optimized (recommended) - EC2 Fleet launches instances from Spot Instance pools with optimal capacity for the number of instances that are launching. To give certain instance types a higher chance of launching first, use capacity-optimized-prioritized. Set a priority for each instance type by using the Priority parameter for LaunchTemplateOverrides. You can assign the same priority to different LaunchTemplateOverrides. EC2 implements the priorities on a best-effort basis, but optimizes for capacity first. capacity-optimized-prioritized is supported only if your fleet uses a launch template. Note that if the On-Demand AllocationStrategy is set to prioritized, the same priority is applied when fulfilling On-Demand capacity. Default: lowest-price
