    * The allocation strategy to use for the compute resource if not enough instances of the best fitting instance type can be allocated. This might be because of availability of the instance type in the Region or Amazon EC2 service limits. For more information, see Allocation strategies in the Batch User Guide.  This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.   BEST_FIT (default)  Batch selects an instance type that best fits the needs of the jobs with a preference for the lowest-cost instance type. If additional instances of the selected instance type aren't available, Batch waits for the additional instances to be available. If there aren't enough instances available, or if the user is reaching Amazon EC2 service limits then additional jobs aren't run until the currently running jobs have completed. This allocation strategy keeps costs lower but can limit scaling. If you are using Spot Fleets with BEST_FIT then the Spot Fleet IAM Role must be specified. Compute resources that use a BEST_FIT allocation strategy don't support infrastructure updates and can't update some parameters. For more information, see Updating compute environments in the Batch User Guide.  BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE  Batch will select additional instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types with a lower cost per unit vCPU. If additional instances of the previously selected instance types aren't available, Batch will select new instance types.  SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED  Batch will select one or more instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types that are less likely to be interrupted. This allocation strategy is only available for Spot Instance compute resources.   With both BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE and SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED strategies, Batch might need to go above maxvCpus to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, Batch never exceeds maxvCpus by more than a single instance.
