  /**
    * The quantity of the specified resource to reserve for the container. The values vary based on the type specified.  type="GPU"  The number of physical GPUs to reserve for the container. The number of GPUs reserved for all containers in a job shouldn't exceed the number of available GPUs on the compute resource that the job is launched on.  GPUs are not available for jobs that are running on Fargate resources.   type="MEMORY"  The memory hard limit (in MiB) present to the container. This parameter is supported for jobs that are running on EC2 resources. If your container attempts to exceed the memory specified, the container is terminated. This parameter maps to Memory in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --memory option to docker run. You must specify at least 4 MiB of memory for a job. This is required but can be specified in several places for multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs. It must be specified for each node at least once. This parameter maps to Memory in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --memory option to docker run.  If you're trying to maximize your resource utilization by providing your jobs as much memory as possible for a particular instance type, see Memory management in the Batch User Guide.  For jobs that are running on Fargate resources, then value is the hard limit (in MiB), and must match one of the supported values and the VCPU values must be one of the values supported for that memory value.  value = 512   VCPU = 0.25  value = 1024   VCPU = 0.25 or 0.5  value = 2048   VCPU = 0.25, 0.5, or 1  value = 3072   VCPU = 0.5, or 1  value = 4096   VCPU = 0.5, 1, or 2  value = 5120, 6144, or 7168   VCPU = 1 or 2  value = 8192   VCPU = 1, 2, or 4  value = 9216, 10240, 11264, 12288, 13312, 14336, 15360, or 16384   VCPU = 2 or 4  value = 17408, 18432, 19456, 20480, 21504, 22528, 23552, 24576, 25600, 26624, 27648, 28672, 29696, or 30720   VCPU = 4    type="VCPU"  The number of vCPUs reserved for the container. This parameter maps to CpuShares in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --cpu-shares option to docker run. Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. For EC2 resources, you must specify at least one vCPU. This is required but can be specified in several places; it must be specified for each node at least once. For jobs that are running on Fargate resources, then value must match one of the supported values and the MEMORY values must be one of the values supported for that VCPU value.
