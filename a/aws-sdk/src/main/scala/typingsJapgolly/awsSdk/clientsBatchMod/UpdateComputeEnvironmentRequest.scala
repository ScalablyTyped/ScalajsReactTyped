Likewise, if the compute environment has a regular IAM role, it can't be changed to use a service-linked role. To update the parameters for the compute environment that require an infrastructure update to change, the AWSServiceRoleForBatch service-linked role must be used. For more information, see Updating compute environments in the Batch User Guide.  If your specified role has a path other than /, then you must either specify the full role ARN (recommended) or prefix the role name with the path.  Depending on how you created your Batch service role, its ARN might contain the service-role path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the service-role path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.

Compute environments in the ENABLED state can accept jobs from a queue and scale in or out automatically based on the workload demand of its associated queues. If the state is ENABLED, then the Batch scheduler can attempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand. If the state is DISABLED, then the Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a STARTING or RUNNING state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the DISABLED state don't scale out. However, they scale in to minvCpus value after instances become idle.
