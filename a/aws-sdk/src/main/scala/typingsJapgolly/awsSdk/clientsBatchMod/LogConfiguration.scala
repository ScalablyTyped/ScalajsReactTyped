    * The log driver to use for the container. The valid values listed for this parameter are log drivers that the Amazon ECS container agent can communicate with by default. The supported log drivers are awslogs, fluentd, gelf, json-file, journald, logentries, syslog, and splunk.  Jobs that are running on Fargate resources are restricted to the awslogs and splunk log drivers.   awslogs  Specifies the Amazon CloudWatch Logs logging driver. For more information, see Using the awslogs log driver in the Batch User Guide and Amazon CloudWatch Logs logging driver in the Docker documentation.  fluentd  Specifies the Fluentd logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see Fluentd logging driver in the Docker documentation.  gelf  Specifies the Graylog Extended Format (GELF) logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see Graylog Extended Format logging driver in the Docker documentation.  journald  Specifies the journald logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see Journald logging driver in the Docker documentation.  json-file  Specifies the JSON file logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see JSON File logging driver in the Docker documentation.  splunk  Specifies the Splunk logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see Splunk logging driver in the Docker documentation.  syslog  Specifies the syslog logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see Syslog logging driver in the Docker documentation.    If you have a custom driver that's not listed earlier that you want to work with the Amazon ECS container agent, you can fork the Amazon ECS container agent project that's available on GitHub and customize it to work with that driver. We encourage you to submit pull requests for changes that you want to have included. However, Amazon Web Services doesn't currently support running modified copies of this software.  This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"
