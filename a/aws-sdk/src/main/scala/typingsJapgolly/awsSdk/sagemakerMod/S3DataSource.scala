    * If you want Amazon SageMaker to replicate the entire dataset on each ML compute instance that is launched for model training, specify FullyReplicated.  If you want Amazon SageMaker to replicate a subset of data on each ML compute instance that is launched for model training, specify ShardedByS3Key. If there are n ML compute instances launched for a training job, each instance gets approximately 1/n of the number of S3 objects. In this case, model training on each machine uses only the subset of training data.  Don't choose more ML compute instances for training than available S3 objects. If you do, some nodes won't get any data and you will pay for nodes that aren't getting any training data. This applies in both File and Pipe modes. Keep this in mind when developing algorithms.  In distributed training, where you use multiple ML compute EC2 instances, you might choose ShardedByS3Key. If the algorithm requires copying training data to the ML storage volume (when TrainingInputMode is set to File), this copies 1/n of the number of objects.

A manifest might look like this: s3://bucketname/example.manifest   The manifest is an S3 object which is a JSON file with the following format:   The preceding JSON matches the following s3Uris:   [ {"prefix": "s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/"},   "relative/path/to/custdata-1",   "relative/path/custdata-2",   ...   "relative/path/custdata-N"   ]   The preceding JSON matches the following s3Uris:   s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/relative/path/to/custdata-1   s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/relative/path/custdata-2   ...   s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/relative/path/custdata-N  The complete set of s3uris in this manifest is the input data for the channel for this datasource. The object that each s3uris points to must be readable by the IAM role that Amazon SageMaker uses to perform tasks on your behalf.
