Contact your AWS administrator for help. For more information, see Setting Up AWS Application Discovery Service in the Application Discovery Service User Guide.   DELIVERY_STREAM_LIMIT_FAILURE - You reached the limit for Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams. Reduce the number of streams or request a limit increase and try again. For more information, see Kinesis Data Streams Limits in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide.   FIREHOSE_ROLE_MISSING - The Data Exploration feature is in an error state because your IAM User is missing the AWSApplicationDiscoveryServiceFirehose role. Turn on Data Exploration in Amazon Athena and try again. For more information, see Step 3: Provide Application Discovery Service Access to Non-Administrator Users by Attaching Policies in the Application Discovery Service User Guide.   FIREHOSE_STREAM_DOES_NOT_EXIST - The Data Exploration feature is in an error state because your IAM User is missing one or more of the Kinesis data delivery streams.   INTERNAL_FAILURE - The Data Exploration feature is in an error state because of an internal failure. Try again later. If this problem persists, contact AWS Support.   S3_BUCKET_LIMIT_FAILURE - You reached the limit for Amazon S3 buckets. Reduce the number of Amazon S3 buckets or request a limit increase and try again. For more information, see Bucket Restrictions and Limitations in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.   S3_NOT_SIGNED_UP - Your account is not signed up for the Amazon S3 service. You must sign up before you can use Amazon S3. You can sign up at the following URL: https://aws.amazon.com/s3.
