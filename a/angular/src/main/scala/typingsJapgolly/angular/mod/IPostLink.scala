    * templateUrl directives will not have been compiled and linked since they are waiting for their template to load
    * asynchronously and their own compilation and linking has been suspended until that occurs. This hook can be considered
    * analogous to the ngAfterViewInit and ngAfterContentInit hooks in Angular 2. Since the compilation process is rather
    * different in Angular 1 there is no direct mapping and care should be taken when upgrading.
