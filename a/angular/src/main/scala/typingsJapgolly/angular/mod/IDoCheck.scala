    * Any actions that you wish to take in response to the changes that you detect must be invoked from this hook;
    * implementing this has no effect on when `$onChanges` is called. For example, this hook could be useful if you wish
    * to perform a deep equality check, or to check a `Dat`e object, changes to which would not be detected by Angular's
    * change detector and thus not trigger `$onChanges`. This hook is invoked with no arguments; if detecting changes,
    * you must store the previous value(s) for comparison to the current values.
