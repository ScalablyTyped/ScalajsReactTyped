  * A view in the drawing framework is any object that paints into a pane.

  * Typical examples are the Impress views that show a graphical representation of a document. But the task pane, which is primarily a container of
  * dialogs, is a view as well.
  *
  * Luckily the drawing framework does not need to know much about what a view is. It just needs to identify view objects and a typesafe way to reference
  * them.
  *
  * The URL prefix of views is `private:resource/view`
