    * record change, the content of the database field is taken, interpreted as image, and displayed in the control. ;  Unlike other more text-based
    * controls, it does not interpret the content of the field as text or double, but as binary stream (see {@link
    * com.sun.star.sdb.XColumn.getBinaryStream()} ).
    *
    * Usually, an image control model can be bound to binary columns only, namely {@link com.sun.star.sdbc.DataType.BINARY} , {@link
    * com.sun.star.sdbc.DataType.VARBINARY} , {@link com.sun.star.sdbc.DataType.LONGVARBINARY} , {@link com.sun.star.sdbc.DataType.OTHER} , {@link

    *
    * Note that besides taking the image to be displayed from the bound field, there is another option. The {@link
    * com.sun.star.awt.UnoControlImageControlModel.ImageURL} property specifies the URL of an image to be displayed. If this property is changed from
    * outside, the respective file is loaded and set as image source.
    *
    * In a usual data form, the scenario will be as follows: There is a {@link DatabaseImageControl} as part of the document model, which acts as control
    * model for an {@link com.sun.star.form.control.ImageControl} .
    *
    * The control is an {@link com.sun.star.awt.XImageConsumer} for the {@link com.sun.star.awt.XImageProducer} supplied by the model.
    *
    * Whenever the form's cursor is positioned on a new record, the column the control model is bound to is examined for a binary data stream. This stream
    * is set as source at the image producer, which notifies it's consumers, which leads to the control displaying the image.
    *
    * When the user by some interaction tells the control to contain a new image, this is exchanged by URL. For example, implementations of the control
    * service may allow the user to browse for image. After this, the URL of the image is set as {@link
    * com.sun.star.awt.UnoControlImageControlModel.ImageURL} property at the model. ;  Now the control loads the image determined by the property value, and
    * starts producing a new data stream, which is displayed by the control (which is a consumer for this stream). ;  From now on, the control and thus the
    * database record counts as modified. If the cursor of the form is moved further, the modified record is saved, means the content of the image pointed
    * to by {@link com.sun.star.awt.UnoControlImageControlModel.ImageURL} is saved into the column.
