/**
  * is the main interface implemented by the {@link Wizard} services.
  *
  * A wizard is a dialog which guides the user through a number of tasks (usually input of data), which the user can accomplish either sequentially or
  * out-of-order. For this, a wizard is comprised of a number of tab pages, each page representing a single **step** .
  *
  * Sequential navigation in a wizard is done via a **Next** and a **Back** button. Non-sequential navigation is done via a roadmap, which is displayed on
  * the left hand side of the wizard dialog, lists all available steps, and allows jumping to a certain step (where the creator of the wizard can restrict
  * the available steps depending on the current situation in the wizard, see below).
  *
  * A sequence of steps in a wizard dialog is called a **path** . A given wizard can support one or multiple paths, which are declared at the time of
  * construction of the wizard.
  *
  * In the simplest case, where the wizard supports only one path, all available steps are displayed in the roadmap, and the user can simply travel
  * through them as desired.
  *
  * If the wizard is more complex, and supports multiple paths, things become more complicated. In a given situation of the wizard, where the user is at
  * step **k** of the current path, the **potential** or **conflicting** paths are those whose first **k** steps are the same as in the current path.
  * Obviously, there's at least one potential path in every situation: the current one. If there is more than one, then the future steps in the dialog are
  * not finally decided. In such a case, the roadmap will display future steps up to the point where the potential paths diverge, and then an item **...**
  * indicating that the order of steps is undecided.
  *
  * An {@link XWizardController} can declare a certain path as active path by calling the {@link activatePath()} method. Usually, this is done depending
  * on user input. For instance, your wizard could have radio buttons on the first page which effectively decide about which path to take in the wizard.
  *
  * Single steps in the wizard can be freely enabled and disabled, using the {@link enablePage()} method. Disabled pages are skipped during sequential
  * traveling, and not selectable in the roadmap.
  *
  * The state of the **Next** button in the dialog will be automatically maintained in most situations, depending on the results of calls to the {@link
  * XWizardController.canAdvance()} and {@link XWizardPage.canAdvance()} methods. More sophisticated wizard logic, however, will need manual calls to the
  * {@link enableButton()} method. Also, the **Finish** button needs to be maintained by the wizard's controller, too, as it cannot be decided generically
  * in which situations it should be enabled or disabled.

    * page within the current path.

    * switch to the second path anymore.

    * @throws com::sun::star::container::NoSuchElementException if there is no path with the given index
    * @throws com::sun::star::util::InvalidStateException if the path cannot be activated in the current state of the wizard.
