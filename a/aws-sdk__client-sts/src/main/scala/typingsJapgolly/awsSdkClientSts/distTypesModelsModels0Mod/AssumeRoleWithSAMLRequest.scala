    * <p>The duration, in seconds, of the role session. Your role session lasts for the duration
    *          that you specify for the <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter, or until the time
    *          specified in the SAML authentication response's <code>SessionNotOnOrAfter</code> value,
    *          whichever is shorter. You can provide a <code>DurationSeconds</code> value from 900 seconds
    *          (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have
    *          a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting, the
    *          operation fails. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your
    *          administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails. To learn
    *          how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session">View the
    *             Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the

    *          <p>By default, the value is set to <code>3600</code> seconds. </p>
    *          <note>
    *             <p>The <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter is separate from the duration of a console
    *             session that you might request using the returned credentials. The request to the
    *             federation endpoint for a console sign-in token takes a <code>SessionDuration</code>
    *             parameter that specifies the maximum length of the console session. For more
    *             information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-custom-url.html">Creating a URL
