/**
  * The TaskConnection API provides action methods (no event subscriptions) which can be called to manipulate the state of a particular task connection within a contact.
  * Like contacts, connections come and go.
  * It is good practice not to persist these objects or keep them as internal state.
  * If you need to, store the `contactId` and `connectionId` of the connection and make sure that the contact and connection still exist by fetching them in order from the `Agent` API object before calling methods on them.
