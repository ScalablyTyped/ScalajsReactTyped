    * Specifies a search distance from a given [geometry](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-layers-support-FeatureFilter.html#geometry) in a spatial filter. The [units property](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-layers-support-FeatureFilter.html#units) indicates the unit of measurement. In essence, setting this property creates a buffer at the specified size around the input [geometry](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-layers-support-FeatureFilter.html#geometry). The filter will use that buffer to display features in the layer or layer view that adhere to the to the indicated [spatial relationship](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-layers-support-FeatureFilter.html#spatialRelationship).

  /**
    * For spatial filters, this parameter defines the spatial relationship to filter features in the layer view against the filter [geometry](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-layers-support-FeatureFilter.html#geometry). The spatial relationships discover how features are spatially related to each other. For example, you may want to know if a polygon representing a county completely contains points representing settlements.  The spatial relationship is determined by whether the boundaries or interiors of a geometry intersect.
    *   * Boundary — The endpoints of all linear parts for line features, or the linear outline of a polygon. Only lines and polygons have boundaries.
    *   * Interior — Points are entirely interior and have no boundary. For lines and polygons, the interior is any part of the geometry that is not part of the boundary.
    *
    *
    * The possible values for this parameter are described below and the images highlight the geometries returned for the specified spatial relationship for given geometries.  The `intersects` spatial relationship returns features in the layer view that intersect the filter [geometry](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-layers-support-FeatureFilter.html#geometry).
    * > **Known Limitations**  The filter of [SceneLayerView](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-layers-SceneLayerView.html) with 3D object scene layers only supports the spatial relationships `contains`, `intersects` and `disjoint`.
    * ![intersects](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/assets/img/apiref/layers/spatialRelationships/intersects.png)  The `contains` spatial relationship returns features in the layer view that are completely contained by the filter [geometry](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-layers-support-FeatureFilter.html#geometry).  ![contains](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/assets/img/apiref/layers/spatialRelationships/contains.png)  The `crosses` spatial relationship returns features in the layer view when the interior of a filter [geometry](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-layers-support-FeatureFilter.html#geometry) comes into contact with the interior or boundary of features in the layer view. In other words, the geometries share some interior area, but not all interior area.  ![crosses](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/assets/img/apiref/layers/spatialRelationships/crosses.png)  The `envelope-intersects` spatial relationship returns features in the layer view that intersect the envelope (or extent) of the filter [geometry](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-layers-support-FeatureFilter.html#geometry).  ![envelope-intersects](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/assets/img/apiref/layers/spatialRelationships/envelope-intersects.png)  The `overlaps` spatial relationship returns features in the layer view that overlap the filter [geometry](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-layers-support-FeatureFilter.html#geometry). Only features of the same geometry can be compared.  ![overlaps](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/assets/img/apiref/layers/spatialRelationships/overlap.png)  The `touches` spatial relationship returns features in the layer view that touch the filter [geometry](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-layers-support-FeatureFilter.html#geometry). The boundaries of the geometries intersect, but not their interiors.  ![touches](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/assets/img/apiref/layers/spatialRelationships/touches.png)  The `within` spatial relationship returns features in the layer view that completely contain the filter [geometry](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-layers-support-FeatureFilter.html#geometry). In other words, the filter geometry is completely `within` the features in the layer view. It is opposite of `contains`.  ![within](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/assets/img/apiref/layers/spatialRelationships/within.png)  The `disjoint` spatial relationship returns features in the layer view that do not intersect the filter [geometry](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-layers-support-FeatureFilter.html#geometry) in anyway. Opposite of `intersects`.  ![disjoint](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/assets/img/apiref/layers/spatialRelationships/disjoint.png)
