    * Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address.
    *
    * Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may
    * sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g.
    * \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of
    * address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country/region of the
    * address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is
    * used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and
    * \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line
    * of an address can be selected based on the language.
    *
    * The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists
    * of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the
    * address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very
    * approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be
    * made about any of the address components until it was at least
    * partially resolved.
    *
    * Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and
    * then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured
    * addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be
    * localities or administrative areas).
