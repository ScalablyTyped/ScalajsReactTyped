    *
    * - initialize: The input is being prepared. Examples of typical
    *      initialization tasks include injecting default options computing
    *      derived parameters.
    * - serialize: The input is complete and ready to be serialized. Examples
    *      of typical serialization tasks include input validation and building
    *      an HTTP request from user input.
    * - build: The input has been serialized into an HTTP request, but that
    *      request may require further modification. Any request alterations
    *      will be applied to all retries. Examples of typical build tasks
    *      include injecting HTTP headers that describe a stable aspect of the
    *      request, such as `Content-Length` or a body checksum.
    * - finalize: The request is being prepared to be sent over the wire. The
    *      request in this stage should already be semantically complete and
    *      should therefore only be altered as match the recipient's
    *      expectations. Examples of typical finalization tasks include request
    *      signing and injecting hop-by-hop headers.
    *
    *      Unlike initialization and build handlers, which are executed once
    *      per operation execution, finalization handlers will be executed for
    *      each HTTP request sent.
