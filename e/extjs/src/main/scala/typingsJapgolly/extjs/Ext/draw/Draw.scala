  		* @param from Date The minimum value in the data
  		* @param to Date The maximum value in the data
  		* @param step Array An array with two components: The first is the unit of the step (day, month, year, etc). The second is the number of units for the step (1, 2, etc.). If the number is an integer, it represents the number of units for the step ([Ext.Date.DAY, 2] means "Every other day"). If the number is a fraction, it represents the number of steps per unit ([Ext.Date.DAY, 1/2] means "Twice a day"). If the unit is the month, the steps may be adjusted depending on the month. For instance [Ext.Date.MONTH, 1/3], which means "Three times a month", generates steps on the 1st, the 10th and the 20th of every month regardless of whether a month has 28 days or 31 days. The steps are generated as follows: - [Ext.Date.MONTH, n]: on the current date every 'n' months, maxed to the number of days in the month. - [Ext.Date.MONTH, 1/2]: on the 1st and 15th of every month. - [Ext.Date.MONTH, 1/3]: on the 1st, 10th and 20th of every month. - [Ext.Date.MONTH, 1/4]: on the 1st, 8th, 15th and 22nd of every month.
