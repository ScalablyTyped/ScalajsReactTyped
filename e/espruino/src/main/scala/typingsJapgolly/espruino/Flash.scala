* <p>This module allows access to read and write the STM32&#39;s flash memory.</p>

* memory belonging to Espruino or even its bootloader. If you damage the bootloader
* then you may need external hardware such as a USB-TTL converter to restore it. For
* more information on restoring the bootloader see <code>Advanced Reflashing</code> in your
* board&#39;s reference pages.</p>
* <p>To see which areas of memory you can and can&#39;t overwrite, look at the values
* reported by <code>process.memory()</code>.</p>
