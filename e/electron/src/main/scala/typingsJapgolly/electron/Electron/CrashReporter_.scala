    * reports. You can pass different options to crashReporter.start when calling from
    * different processes. Note Child processes created via the child_process module
    * will not have access to the Electron modules. Therefore, to collect crash
    * reports from them, use process.crashReporter.start instead. Pass the same
    * options as above along with an additional one called crashesDirectory that
    * should point to a directory to store the crash reports temporarily. You can test
    * this out by calling process.crash() to crash the child process. Note: If you
    * need send additional/updated extra parameters after your first call start you
    * can call addExtraParameter on macOS or call start again with the new/updated
    * extra parameters on Linux and Windows. Note: On macOS and windows, Electron uses
    * a new crashpad client for crash collection and reporting. If you want to enable
    * crash reporting, initializing crashpad from the main process using
    * crashReporter.start is required regardless of which process you want to collect
    * crashes from. Once initialized this way, the crashpad handler collects crashes
    * from all processes. You still have to call crashReporter.start from the renderer
    * or child process, otherwise crashes from them will get reported without
    * companyName, productName or any of the extra information.
