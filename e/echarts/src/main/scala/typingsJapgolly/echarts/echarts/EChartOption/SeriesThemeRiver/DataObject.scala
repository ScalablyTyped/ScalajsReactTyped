    * **data specification:**
    *
    * As what is shown above, the data format of theme river is
    * double dimensional array.
    * Each item of the inner array consists of the time attribute
    * , the value at a time point and the name of an event or theme.
    * It needs to be noticed that you should provide an event or
    * theme with a complete time quantum as main river.
    * Other events and themes are based on the main river.
    * The default value of time point should be set as 0.
    * That is to say other events or themes are included in the
    * main river.
    * Once they are beyond the main river, the layout would be
    * wrong.
    * That is because a baseline should be calculated to draw each
    * event as ribbon shape when the whole diagram layout is calculated.
    * As the example above, the event "SS" is a main river.
    * After dispose, we would complete these 3 default time points
    * with the format of \["2015/11/08",0,"DQ"\], \["2015/11/12",0,"DQ"\],
    * ［"2015/11/13",0,"DQ"］, making it align with the main river.
    * From what is mentioned, we could set default value on any
    * position of a complete time period.
    *
    *
    * @see https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#series-themeRiver.data.name
