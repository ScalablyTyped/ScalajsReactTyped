  * This event is used to create a static particle effect in the world. This particle effect is only visible to the specific player that is running the client script where you fired the event. Any effect defined in a JSON file (both in your resource pack and in Minecraft) can be used here. Once the effect is spawned you won't be able to control it further. Unlike the server version of the event, the client version will spawn the particle in the dimension the player is currently in.
