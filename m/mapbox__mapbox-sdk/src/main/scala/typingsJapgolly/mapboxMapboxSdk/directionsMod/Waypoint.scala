    * Used to filter the road segment the waypoint will be placed on by direction and dictates the angle of approach.
    * This option should always be used in conjunction with the  radiuses parameter. The parameter takes two values per waypoint.
    * The first value is an angle clockwise from true north between 0 and 360, and the second is the range of degrees the angle can deviate by.
    * The recommended value for the range is 45° or 90°, as bearing measurements tend to be inaccurate.
    * This is useful for making sure the new routes of rerouted vehicles continue traveling in their current direction.
    * A request that does this would provide bearing and radius values for the first waypoint and leave the remaining values empty.
    * If provided, the list of bearings must be the same length as the list of waypoints.
    * However, you can skip a coordinate and show its position in the list with the  ; separator.
