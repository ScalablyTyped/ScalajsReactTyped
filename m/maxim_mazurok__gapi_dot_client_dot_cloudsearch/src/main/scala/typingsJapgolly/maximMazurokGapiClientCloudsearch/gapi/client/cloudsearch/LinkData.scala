    * An Attachment represents the structured entity to which we are linking. It contains an Embed (apps/tacotown/proto/embeds/embed_client.proto) with fields specific to the appropriate
    * type of linked entity. For example, if we are linking to a photo album, the Embed may include the album ID and gaia ID of the creator. Clients that understand the Embed type within
    * the Attachment may construct and/or decorate their link appropriately e.g. to make use of type-specific functionality or first-party integrations. The link_target and (if
    * appropriate) display_url fields must still be set even when an Attachment is present, so that clients who do not know how to interpret the Attachment can fall back to those fields,
    * and render the Segment as an ordinary web link. N.B. Even when an Attachment is present, the intention of a "LINK" Segment is for the Segment to be presented inline with the rest of
    * the text of a post or comment, with a clickable link or other UI suitable for inlining (though the client may modify the UI based on Attachment data, e.g. to add appropriate hovers,
    * icons, etc.). When an entity is intended to be rendered separately from the main body of the post/comment, a separate Attachment proto can be added outside the set of Segments. N.B.
    * Within the Attachment, fields of EmbedClientItem have their own visibility annotations, which should be enforced separately from Segment visibility annotations. See:
    * apps/tacotown/proto/embeds/embed_annotations.proto
