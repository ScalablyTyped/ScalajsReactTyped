  /**
    * Restricts notifications sent for messages matching a filter. If this is empty, all messages are matched. The following syntax is available: * A string field value can be written as
    * text inside quotation marks, for example `"query text"`. The only valid relational operation for text fields is equality (`=`), where text is searched within the field, rather than
    * having the field be equal to the text. For example, `"Comment = great"` returns messages with `great` in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a
    * decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator (`=`), along with the less than/greater than operators (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`).
    * Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. Fields
    * with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator
    * (`=`) , along with the less than/greater than operators (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression
    * to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a
    * quoted string, it is not treated as special, it's just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. The
    * following fields and functions are available for filtering: * `message_type`, from the MSH-9.1 field. For example, `NOT message_type = "ADT"`. * `send_date` or `sendDate`, the
    * YYYY-MM-DD date the message was sent in the dataset's time_zone, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_date < "2017-01-02"`. * `send_time`, the timestamp when the message was
    * sent, using the RFC3339 time format for comparisons, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_time < "2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00"`. * `create_time`, the timestamp when the message
    * was created in the HL7v2 store. Use the RFC3339 time format for comparisons. For example, `create_time < "2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00"`. * `send_facility`, the care center that the
    * message came from, from the MSH-4 segment. For example, `send_facility = "ABC"`. * `PatientId(value, type)`, which matches if the message lists a patient having an ID of the given
    * value and type in the PID-2, PID-3, or PID-4 segments. For example, `PatientId("123456", "MRN")`. * `labels.x`, a string value of the label with key `x` as set using the
    * Message.labels map. For example, `labels."priority"="high"`. The operator `:*` can be used to assert the existence of a label. For example, `labels."priority":*`.

    * The [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/) topic that notifications of changes are published on. Supplied by the client. The notification is a `PubsubMessage` with the
    * following fields: * `PubsubMessage.Data` contains the resource name. * `PubsubMessage.MessageId` is the ID of this notification. It's guaranteed to be unique within the topic. *
    * `PubsubMessage.PublishTime` is the time when the message was published. Note that notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. [Topic
