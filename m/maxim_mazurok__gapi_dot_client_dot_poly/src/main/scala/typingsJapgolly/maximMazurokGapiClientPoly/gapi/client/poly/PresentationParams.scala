    * be laid out such that the base of the tower is on the YZ plane and the tip of the tower is towards positive X. In this case this quaternion would specify a rotation (of 90 degrees
    * about the Z axis) such that in the presentation space the base of the tower is aligned with the XZ plane, and the tip of the tower lies towards +Y. This rotation is unrelated to the
    * object's pose in the web preview, which is just a camera position setting and is *not* reflected in this rotation. Please note: this is applicable only to the gLTF.
