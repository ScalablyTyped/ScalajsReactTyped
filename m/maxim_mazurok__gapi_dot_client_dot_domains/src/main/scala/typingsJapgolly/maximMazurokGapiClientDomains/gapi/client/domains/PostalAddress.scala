    * single field (e.g. "Austin, TX"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be "envelope order" for the country/region of the address. In
    * places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. "ja" for large-to-small ordering and "ja-Latn" or "en" for small-to-large). This way, the
    * most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining
    * information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of
    * the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to
    * handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).
