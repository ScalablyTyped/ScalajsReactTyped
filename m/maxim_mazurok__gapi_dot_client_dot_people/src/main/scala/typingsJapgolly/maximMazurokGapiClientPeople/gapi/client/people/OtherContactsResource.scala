    * List all "Other contacts", that is contacts that are not in a contact group. "Other contacts" are typically auto created contacts from interactions. Sync tokens expire 7 days after
    * the full sync. A request with an expired sync token will get an error with an [google.rpc.ErrorInfo](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors#error_info) with reason
    * "EXPIRED_SYNC_TOKEN". In the case of such an error clients should make a full sync request without a `sync_token`. The first page of a full sync request has an additional quota. If
    * the quota is exceeded, a 429 error will be returned. This quota is fixed and can not be increased. When the `sync_token` is specified, resources deleted since the last sync will be
    * returned as a person with `PersonMetadata.deleted` set to true. When the `page_token` or `sync_token` is specified, all other request parameters must match the first call. Writes
    * may have a propagation delay of several minutes for sync requests. Incremental syncs are not intended for read-after-write use cases. See example usage at [List the user's other
    * contacts that have changed](/people/v1/other-contacts#list_the_users_other_contacts_that_have_changed).
