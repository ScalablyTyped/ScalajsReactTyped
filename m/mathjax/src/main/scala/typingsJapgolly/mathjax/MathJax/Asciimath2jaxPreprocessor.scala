    * want to use them for math delimiters, you must specify them explicitly.)
    *
    * Note that the delimiters can’t look like HTML tags (i.e., can’t include the less-than sign), as these would be
    * turned into tags by the browser before MathJax has the chance to run. You can only include text, not tags,

    * match a complete word, so setting ignoreClass: "class2" would cause it to match an element with class="class1
    * class2 class3" but not class="myclass2". Note that you can assign several classes by separating them by the
