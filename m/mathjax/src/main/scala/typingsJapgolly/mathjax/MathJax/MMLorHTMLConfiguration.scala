    * complicated output generated by MathJax, so their settings are "HTML" by default. Although Firefox does
    * support a large subset of MathJax, it does not implement all the features needed by MathJax, and so it is
    * also set to "HTML" by default (this is new in v2.0).

    * one has been chosen by MMLorHTML.js.
