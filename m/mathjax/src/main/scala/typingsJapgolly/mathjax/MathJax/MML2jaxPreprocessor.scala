  /*This controls whether mml2jax inserts MathJax_Preview spans to make a preview available, and what preview to
    * use, when it locates mathematics on the page. Possible values are: "mathml", "alttext", , "altimg", "none",
    * or an HTML snippet.
    *
    * The default is "mathml", in which case MathJax keeps the content of the <math> tag as the preview (until it is
    * processed by MathJax). Set to "alttext", to use the <math> tagâ€™s alttext attribute as the preview, if the tag
    * has one. Set to "altimg" to use an image described by the altimg* attributes of the <math> element. Set to
    * "none" to prevent the previews from being inserted (the math will simply disappear until it is typeset). Set
    * to an array containing the description of an HTML snippet in order to use the same preview for all equations
    * on the page (e.g., you could have it say "[math]" or load an image).
    *
    * Examples:
    *
    * preview: ["[math]"],     //  insert the text "[math]" as the preview
    * preview: [["img",{src: "/images/mypic.jpg"}]],  // insert an image as the preview
