/**
The editor state class is a persistent (immutable) data structure.
To update a state, you [create](https://codemirror.net/6/docs/ref/#state.EditorState.update) a
[transaction](https://codemirror.net/6/docs/ref/#state.Transaction), which produces a _new_ state
instance, without modifying the original object.
As such, _never_ mutate properties of a state directly. That'll
just break things.
