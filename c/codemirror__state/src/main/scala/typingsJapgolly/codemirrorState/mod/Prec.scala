/**
By default extensions are registered in the order they are found
in the flattened form of nested array that was provided.
Individual extension values can be assigned a precedence to
override this. Extensions that do not have a precedence set get
the precedence of the nearest parent with a precedence, or
[`default`](https://codemirror.net/6/docs/ref/#state.Prec.default) if there is no such parent. The
final ordering of extensions is determined by first sorting by
precedence and then by order within each precedence.
