Changes to the editor state are grouped into transactions.
Typically, a user action creates a single transaction, which may
contain any number of document changes, may change the selection,
or have other effects. Create a transaction by calling
[`EditorState.update`](https://codemirror.net/6/docs/ref/#state.EditorState.update), or immediately
dispatch one by calling
[`EditorView.dispatch`](https://codemirror.net/6/docs/ref/#view.EditorView.dispatch).
