    *  of by setting the 'enable-ble-advertising-in-apps' flag.

    *  attempting to use the device in both modes will lead to undefined behavior
    *  or prevent other central-role applications from behaving correctly
    *  (including the discovery of Bluetooth Low Energy devices).

    * @param advertisement The advertisement to advertise.
    * @param callback Called once the registeration is done and we've started advertising. Returns the id of the created advertisement.
