    * UI in your app explaining what the authorization is for. Failing to do this will cause
    * your users to get authorization requests, or Chrome sign in screens if they are not
    * signed in, with with no context. In particular, do not use getAuthToken interactively
    * when your app is first launched.

    * @param [callback] Called with an OAuth2 access token as specified by the manifest,
    *                   or undefined if there was an error.
