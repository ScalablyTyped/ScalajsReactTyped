      * Computes a point that can be used as the occludee position to the visibility functions.
      * Use a radius of zero for the occludee radius.  Typically, a user computes a bounding sphere around
      * an object that is used for visibility; however it is also possible to compute a point that if
      * seen/not seen would also indicate if an object is visible/not visible.  This function is better
      * called for objects that do not move relative to the occluder and is large, such as a chunk of
      * terrain.  You are better off not calling this and using the object's bounding sphere for objects
      * such as a satellite or ground vehicle.
      * @example
      * const cameraPosition = new Cesium.Cartesian3(0, 0, 0);
      * const occluderBoundingSphere = new Cesium.BoundingSphere(new Cesium.Cartesian3(0, 0, -8), 2);
      * const occluder = new Cesium.Occluder(occluderBoundingSphere, cameraPosition);
      * const positions = [new Cesium.Cartesian3(-0.25, 0, -5.3), new Cesium.Cartesian3(0.25, 0, -5.3)];
      * const tileOccluderSphere = Cesium.BoundingSphere.fromPoints(positions);
      * const occludeePosition = tileOccluderSphere.center;
      * const occludeePt = Cesium.Occluder.computeOccludeePoint(occluderBoundingSphere, occludeePosition, positions);
      * @param occluderBoundingSphere - The bounding sphere surrounding the occluder.
      * @param occludeePosition - The point where the occludee (bounding sphere of radius 0) is located.
      * @param positions - List of altitude points on the horizon near the surface of the occluder.
      * @returns An object containing two attributes: <code>occludeePoint</code> and <code>valid</code>
      * which is a boolean value.
