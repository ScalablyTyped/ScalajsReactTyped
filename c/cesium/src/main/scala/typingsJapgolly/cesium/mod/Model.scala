    * @param [options.asynchronous = true] - Determines if model WebGL resource creation will be spread out over several frames or block until completion once all glTF files are loaded.
    * @param [options.clampAnimations = true] - Determines if the model's animations should hold a pose over frames where no keyframes are specified.
    * @param [options.shadows = ShadowMode.ENABLED] - Determines whether the model casts or receives shadows from light sources.
    * @param [options.releaseGltfJson = false] - When true, the glTF JSON is released once the glTF is loaded. This is is especially useful for cases like 3D Tiles, where each .gltf model is unique and caching the glTF JSON is not effective.
    * @param [options.debugShowBoundingVolume = false] - For debugging only. Draws the bounding sphere for each draw command in the model.

    * @param [options.content] - The tile content this model belongs to. This property will be undefined if model is not loaded as part of a tileset.
    * @param [options.heightReference = HeightReference.NONE] - Determines how the model is drawn relative to terrain.

    * @param [options.distanceDisplayCondition] - The condition specifying at what distance from the camera that this model will be displayed.
    * @param [options.color] - A color that blends with the model's rendered color.
    * @param [options.colorBlendMode = ColorBlendMode.HIGHLIGHT] - Defines how the color blends with the model.
    * @param [options.colorBlendAmount = 0.5] - Value used to determine the color strength when the <code>colorBlendMode</code> is <code>MIX</code>. A value of 0.0 results in the model's rendered color while a value of 1.0 results in a solid color, with any value in-between resulting in a mix of the two.

When true, outlines are displayed. When false, outlines are not displayed.
    * @param [options.outlineColor = Color.BLACK] - The color to use when rendering outlines.
    * @param [options.clippingPlanes] - The {@link ClippingPlaneCollection} used to selectively disable rendering the model.
    * @param [options.lightColor] - The light color when shading the model. When <code>undefined</code> the scene's light color is used instead.
    * @param [options.imageBasedLighting] - The properties for managing image-based lighting on this model.
    * @param [options.backFaceCulling = true] - Whether to cull back-facing geometry. When true, back face culling is determined by the material's doubleSided property; when false, back face culling is disabled. Back faces are not culled if the model's color is translucent.
    * @param [options.credit] - A credit for the data source, which is displayed on the canvas.
    * @param [options.showCreditsOnScreen = false] - Whether to display the credits of this model on screen.
    * @param [options.splitDirection = SplitDirection.NONE] - The {@link SplitDirection} split to apply to this model.
    * @param [options.projectTo2D = false] - Whether to accurately project the model's positions in 2D. If this is true, the model will be projected accurately to 2D, but it will use more memory to do so. If this is false, the model will use less memory and will still render in 2D / CV mode, but its positions may be inaccurate. This disables minimumPixelSize and prevents future modification to the model matrix. This also cannot be set after the model has loaded.

For EXT_mesh_features, this is the feature ID's label property, or "featureId_N" (where N is the index in the featureIds array) when not specified. EXT_feature_metadata did not have a label field, so such feature ID sets are always labeled "featureId_N" where N is the index in the list of all feature Ids, where feature ID attributes are listed before feature ID textures. If featureIdLabel is an integer N, it is converted to the string "featureId_N" automatically. If both per-primitive and per-instance feature IDs are present, the instance feature IDs take priority.
