    * Creates a lodash object which wraps value to enable implicit method chain sequences.
    * Methods that operate on and return arrays, collections, and functions can be chained together.
    * Methods that retrieve a single value or may return a primitive value will automatically end the
    * chain sequence and return the unwrapped value. Otherwise, the value must be unwrapped with value().
    *
    * Explicit chain sequences, which must be unwrapped with value(), may be enabled using _.chain.
    *
    * The execution of chained methods is lazy, that is, it's deferred until value() is
    * implicitly or explicitly called.
    *
    * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion. Shortcut fusion
    * is an optimization to merge iteratee calls; this avoids the creation of intermediate
    * arrays and can greatly reduce the number of iteratee executions. Sections of a chain
    * sequence qualify for shortcut fusion if the section is applied to an array and iteratees
    * accept only one argument. The heuristic for whether a section qualifies for shortcut
    * fusion is subject to change.
    *
    * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the value() method is directly or
    * indirectly included in the build.
    *
    * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have Array and String methods.
    * The wrapper Array methods are:
    * concat, join, pop, push, shift, sort, splice, and unshift.
    * The wrapper String methods are:
    * replace and split.
    *
    * The wrapper methods that support shortcut fusion are:
    * at, compact, drop, dropRight, dropWhile, filter, find, findLast, head, initial, last,
    * map, reject, reverse, slice, tail, take, takeRight, takeRightWhile, takeWhile, and toArray
    *
    * The chainable wrapper methods are:
    * after, ary, assign, assignIn, assignInWith, assignWith, at, before, bind, bindAll, bindKey,
    * castArray, chain, chunk, commit, compact, concat, conforms, constant, countBy, create,
    * curry, debounce, defaults, defaultsDeep, defer, delay, difference, differenceBy, differenceWith,
    * drop, dropRight, dropRightWhile, dropWhile, extend, extendWith, fill, filter, flatMap,
