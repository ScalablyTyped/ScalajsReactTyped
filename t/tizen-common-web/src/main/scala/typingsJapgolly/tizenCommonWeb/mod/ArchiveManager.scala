    * Use _mode_ depending on which operation are intended:
    *
    *
    * | Mode | Description |
    * | ----- | ----- |
    * | r | Use this mode for extracting or getting information about the contents of an archive file. <br>    _file_ must exist. If the _file_ does not exist, _onerror_ will be invoked (_NotFoundError_).<br>    When an archive file is opened in this mode, _add()_ will not be available. (_IOError_ will be thrown.) |
    * | w | Use this mode to create an archive file and add files to the archive file. <br> If _file_ does not exist, it will be created. <br> If _file_ exists and the _overwrite_ option is <var>true</var>, the existing file will be overwritten with empty archive. <br> If _file_ exists and the _overwrite_ option is <var>false</var>, _onerror_ callback will be invoked (_InvalidModificationError_). <br> When an archive file is opened in this mode, _getEntries()_, _getEntryByName()_, and _extractAll()_ are not available. (_IOError_ will be thrown.) |
    * | rw | Use this mode for archive zipping/unzipping. <br> If _file_ does not exist, it will be created. <br> If _file_ exists and the _overwrite_ option is <var>true</var>, the existing file will be overwritten with an empty archive. <br> If _file_ exists and the _overwrite_ option is <var>false</var>, the existing contents are preserved. Both adding and extracting will be available. <br>|
    * | a | Use this mode to add new files to an archive file. <br> If _file_ does not exist, it will be created. <br> If _file_ exists, then the previous contents of the archive file are preserved and new files can be added to the archive file. In this mode, _getEntries()_, _getEntryByName()_, and _extractAll()_ are not available. (_IOError_ will be thrown.)|
