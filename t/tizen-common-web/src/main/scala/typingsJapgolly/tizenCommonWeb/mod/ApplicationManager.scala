    *
    * When executed, the implementation must immediately return a listener
    * ID that identifies the listener. After returning the ID, the change
    * detection operation is started asynchronously.
    *
    * The _ApplicationInformationEventCallback_ must be invoked every time a new
    * application is installed, removed, or updated.
    *
    * The change detection must continue until the _removeAppInfoEventListener()_ method is called
    * with the corresponding listener identifier.

    *
