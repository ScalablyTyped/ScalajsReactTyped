    * The Account API provides functionality for using existing configured
    * online accounts and providers, and for creating accounts of known types.
    *
    * The basic concepts are:
    *
    * *   **Provider** is an online service provider entity, such as
    * Google, Vodafone or Facebook. A service provider is identified by its applicationId.
    * Account provider will be registered while the application is installed.
    * The information will be used in the "Add account" screen in Settings.
    * *   **Account** collects all the data (user name, credential, settings)
    * needed for connecting to services. An account is always bound to a single provider,
    * and has a list of service instances bound to the account. The services can be
    * individually enabled and disabled on the given account. For instance,
    * account1@gmail.com can identify a Google account, giving access to services such as
    * gmail, gtalk, Picasa, and Youtube with each service having a separate service
    * instance bound to the account.
    *
    *
    * To use _add(), remove(), and update()_ methods of AccountManager can be invoked only
    * by account provider application. A web application is an account provider when its _config.xml_
    * contains [Account provider section](/application/tizen-studio/web-tools/config-editor#mw_account). For example:
    *
    * ```xml
    * <tizen:account multiple-account-support="true">
    *    <tizen:icon section="Account">icon.png</tizen:icon>
    *    <tizen:icon section="AccountSmall">icon.png</tizen:icon>

    *    <tizen:capability>http://tizen.org/account/capability/contact</tizen:capability>

    * The Filesystem API provides access to a device's filesystem.
    *
    * The filesystem is represented as an abstract collection of disjointed filesystem virtual
    * root locations, each corresponding to a specific location in the device
    * filesystem. The filesystem API exposes the hierarchies below these root
    * locations as autonomous virtual filesystems.
    *
    * Each virtual root has a string name. Each file or directory within the virtual
    * filesystem is addressed using a fully-qualified path of the form:
    * _root name/path_ where _rootname_ is
    * the name of the virtual root and _path_ is the path to the file or
    * directory relative to that root.
    *
    * The following virtual roots must be supported:
    *
    *
    * *   images - the location for images
    * *   videos - the location for videos
    * *   music - the location for sounds
    * *   documents - the location for documents
    * *   downloads - the location for downloaded items
    * *   camera - the location for the pictures and videos taken by a device (supported since Tizen 2.3)
    * *   wgt-package - the location for widget package which is read-only
    * *   wgt-private - the location for a widget's private storage
    * *   wgt-private-tmp - the location for a widget's private volatile storage
    * *   removable\__..._ - the location for external storages. The _"..."_ suffix is a unique identifier of an external storage.
    * To obtain list of available external storages use [listStorages](#FileSystemManager::listStorages).
    *
    *
    * The file URI path is also supported. To access paths out of virtual root, for example "file:///tmp" can be used as location parameter.
    *
    * The implementation must support the use of the following characters in file names:
    *
    * *   Letters (a-z, A-Z)
    * *   Digits (0-9)
    * *   Blank space
    * *   Underscore ("\_")
    * *   Hyphen ("-")
    * *   Period (".")
    *
    *
    * The implementation may support additional characters in file names, depending on platform support.
    *
    * The implementation may forbid the use of additional characters in file names, depending on the platform.
    * The use of the path (component) separator "/" and null character "\\\\x00" should not be allowed in file names.
    *
    * Some other file name and path characteristics are platform-dependent,
    * for example, maximum path length, file name length, case sensitivity, additional
    * character support, etc. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid any dependency
    * on aspects that cannot be supported across multiple platforms.
    *
    * The encoding used for the file path should be UTF-16 (default for ECMAScript String).
    *
    * **Remark:** In order to access files, a proper privilege has to be defined additionally:
    *
    * *   for accessing only internal storage using this API, a privilege [http://tizen.org/privilege/mediastorage](http://tizen.org/privilege/mediastorage) must be provided,

  /**
    * This API provides interfaces for managing stereoscopic 3D effects
    * for television signals.
    *
    * Modern TVs and projectors can display two images, a left image and a right image,
    * which are displayed to the left and right eyes respectively. This technique creates
    * an illusion of depth, which is perceived by users as a 3D image.
    *
    * For more information about stereoscopy, see this
    * [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy).
    *
    * There are several formats of input images supported by the stereoscopy
    * plugin:
    *
    * *   Side-by-side: Left and right images are merged into one
    * picture. The left image is at the left side and the right image is at the right
    * side. Both images are scaled to fit in the original
    * image ratio.
    * *   Top-bottom: Left and right images are merged into one
    * picture. The left image is at the top and the right image is at the bottom.
    * Both images are scaled to fit in the original image ratio.
    * *   Line-by-line: Left and right images are interlaced by row.
    * The first row belongs to the left image and the second row
    * belongs to the right image, and so on.
    * *   Vertical-strip: Left and right images are interlaced by column.
    * The first column belongs to the left image and the second column
    * belongs to the right image, and so on.
    * *   Frame-sequence: Left and right images are interlaced by frames.
    *
    *
    * Advanced devices are able to computationally generate depth
    * data by processing non-stereoscopic images. Depth data is used
    * to render left and right stereoscopic images from a source image which lacks
    * this information. The quality of such stereoscopic images depends
    * on the computational power used for processing, the algorithms used and the properties
    * of the source data. For more information see this
