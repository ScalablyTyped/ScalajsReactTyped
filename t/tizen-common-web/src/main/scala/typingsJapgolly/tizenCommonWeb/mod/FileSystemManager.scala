    *
    * A _location_ can contain a virtual path like "documents/some\_file.txt"

    * A _location_ is not allowed to contain the "." or ".." directory entries inside its value.
    *
    * The list of root locations that must be supported by a compliant implementation are:
    *
    * *   documents - The default folder in which text documents (such as pdf, doc...) are stored by default in a device. For example, in some platforms it corresponds to the "My Documents" folder.
    * *   images - The default folder in which still images, like pictures (in formats including jpg, gif, png, etc.), are stored in the device by default. For example, in some platforms it corresponds to the "My Images" folder.
    * *   music - The default folder in which sound clips (in formats including mp3, aac, etc.) are stored in the device by default. For example, in some platforms it corresponds to the "My Music" folder.
    * *   videos - The default folder in which video clips (in formats including avi, mp4, etc.) are stored in the device by default. For example, in some platforms it corresponds to the "My Videos" folder.
    * *   downloads - The default folder in which downloaded files (from sources including browser, e-mail client, etc.) are stored by default in the device. For example, in some platforms it corresponds to the "Downloads" folder.
    * *   ringtones - The default folder in which ringtones (such as mp3, etc.) are stored in the device.
    * *   camera - The default folder in which pictures and videos taken by a device are stored.
    * *   wgt-package - The read-only folder to which the content of a widget file is extracted.
    * *   wgt-private - The private folder in which a widget stores its information. This folder must be accessible only to the same widget and other widgets or applications must not be able to access the stored information.
    * *   wgt-private-tmp - Temporary, the private folder in which a widget can store data that is available during a widget execution cycle. Content of this folder can be removed from this directory when the widget is closed or the Web Runtime is restarted. This folder must be accessible only to the same widget and other widgets or applications must not be able to access it.

    *
    * The _mode_ parameter specifies whether the resulting _File_ object has read-only access (r access), read and write access (rw access), append access (a access), or write access (w access) to the root location containing directory tree.
    * Permission for the requested access is obtained from the security framework. Once the resulting _File_ object has access, access is inherited by any other _File_ objects that are derived from this instance without any further reference to the security framework, as noted in descriptions of certain methods of _File_.
    *
    * The ErrorCallback is launched with these error types:
    *
    * *   InvalidValuesError - If any of the input parameters contains an invalid value.
    * For example, the mode is w for the read-only virtual roots (wgt-package and ringtones).
    * *   NotFoundError - If the location input argument does not correspond to a valid location.
