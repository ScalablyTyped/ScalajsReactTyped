    * Opens a new tab with this url.
    * The options object can have the following properties:
    * - `active` decides whether the new tab should be focused,
    * - `insert` that inserts the new tab after the current one and
    * - `setParent` makes the browser re-focus the current tab on close.
    *
    * Otherwise the new tab is just appended.
    * If `options` is boolean (loadInBackground) it has the opposite meaning of
    * active and was added to achieve Greasemonkey 3.x compatibility.
    *
    * If neither active nor loadInBackground is given, then the tab will not be
    * focused.
    * @returns Object with the function `close`, the listener `onclosed` and a flag
    * called `closed`.
