  * An atom allows you to treat a JSON value as atomic regardless of its type, ensuring that a JSON object or array is always returned in its entirety. The JSON value must be treated as immutable. Atoms can also be used to associate metadata with a JSON value. This metadata can be used to influence the way values are handled.
