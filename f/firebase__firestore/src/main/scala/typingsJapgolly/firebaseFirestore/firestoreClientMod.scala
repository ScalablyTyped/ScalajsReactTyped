      * The intent here is to "do the right thing" as far as users are concerned.
      * Namely, in cases where offline persistence is requested and possible,
      * enable it, but otherwise fall back to persistence disabled. For the most
      * part we expect this to succeed one way or the other so we don't expect our
      * users to actually wait on the firestore.enablePersistence Promise since
      * they generally won't care.
      *
      * Of course some users actually do care about whether or not persistence
      * was successfully enabled, so the Promise returned from this method
      * indicates this outcome.
      *
      * This presents a problem though: even before enablePersistence resolves or
      * rejects, users may have made calls to e.g. firestore.collection() which
      * means that the FirestoreClient in there will be available and will be
      * enqueuing actions on the async queue.
      *
      * Meanwhile any failure of an operation on the async queue causes it to
      * panic and reject any further work, on the premise that unhandled errors
      * are fatal.
      *
      * Consequently the fallback is handled internally here in start, and if the
      * fallback succeeds we signal success to the async queue even though the
      * start() itself signals failure.
