/**
  * A `Timestamp` represents a point in time independent of any time zone or
  * calendar, represented as seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond
  * resolution in UTC Epoch time.
  *
  * It is encoded using the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar which extends the
  * Gregorian calendar backwards to year one. It is encoded assuming all minutes
  * are 60 seconds long, i.e. leap seconds are "smeared" so that no leap second
  * table is needed for interpretation. Range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to
  * 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z.
  *
  * For examples and further specifications, refer to the
  * {@link https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/timestamp.proto | Timestamp definition}.
