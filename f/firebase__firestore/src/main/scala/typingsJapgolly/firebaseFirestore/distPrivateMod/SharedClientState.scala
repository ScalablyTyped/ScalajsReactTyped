/**
  * A `SharedClientState` keeps track of the global state of the mutations
  * and query targets for all active clients with the same persistence key (i.e.
  * project ID and FirebaseApp name). It relays local changes to other clients
  * and updates its local state as new state is observed.
  *
  * `SharedClientState` is primarily used for synchronization in Multi-Tab
  * environments. Each tab is responsible for registering its active query
  * targets and mutations. `SharedClientState` will then notify the listener
  * assigned to `.syncEngine` for updates to mutations and queries that
  * originated in other clients.
  *
  * To receive notifications, `.syncEngine` and `.onlineStateHandler` has to be
  * assigned before calling `start()`.
