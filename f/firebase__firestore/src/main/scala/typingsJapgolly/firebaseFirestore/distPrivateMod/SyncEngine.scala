/**
  * SyncEngine is the central controller in the client SDK architecture. It is
  * the glue code between the EventManager, LocalStore, and RemoteStore. Some of
  * SyncEngine's responsibilities include:
  * 1. Coordinating client requests and remote events between the EventManager
  *    and the local and remote data stores.
  * 2. Managing a View object for each query, providing the unified view between
  *    the local and remote data stores.
  * 3. Notifying the RemoteStore when the LocalStore has new mutations in its
  *    queue that need sending to the backend.
  *
  * The SyncEngineâ€™s methods should only ever be called by methods running in the
  * global async queue.
  *
  * PORTING NOTE: On Web, SyncEngine does not have an explicit subscribe()
  * function. Instead, it directly depends on EventManager's tree-shakeable API
  * (via `ensureWatchStream()`).
