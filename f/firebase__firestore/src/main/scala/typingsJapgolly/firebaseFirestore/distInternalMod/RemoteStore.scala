/**
  * RemoteStore - An interface to remotely stored data, basically providing a
  * wrapper around the Datastore that is more reliable for the rest of the
  * system.
  *
  * RemoteStore is responsible for maintaining the connection to the server.
  * - maintaining a list of active listens.
  * - reconnecting when the connection is dropped.
  * - resuming all the active listens on reconnect.
  *
  * RemoteStore handles all incoming events from the Datastore.
  * - listening to the watch stream and repackaging the events as RemoteEvents
  * - notifying SyncEngine of any changes to the active listens.
  *
  * RemoteStore takes writes from other components and handles them reliably.
  * - pulling pending mutations from LocalStore and sending them to Datastore.
  * - retrying mutations that failed because of network problems.
  * - acking mutations to the SyncEngine once they are accepted or rejected.
