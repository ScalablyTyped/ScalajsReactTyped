      * Returns whether the index can be used to serve the TargetIndexMatcher's
      * target.
      *
      * An index is considered capable of serving the target when:
      * - The target uses all index segments for its filters and orderBy clauses.
      *   The target can have additional filter and orderBy clauses, but not
      *   fewer.
      * - If an ArrayContains/ArrayContainsAnyfilter is used, the index must also
      *   have a corresponding `CONTAINS` segment.
      * - All directional index segments can be mapped to the target as a series of
      *   equality filters, a single inequality filter and a series of orderBy
      *   clauses.
      * - The segments that represent the equality filters may appear out of order.
      * - The optional segment for the inequality filter must appear after all
      *   equality segments.
      * - The segments that represent that orderBy clause of the target must appear
      *   in order after all equality and inequality segments. Single orderBy
      *   clauses cannot be skipped, but a continuous orderBy suffix may be
      *   omitted.
