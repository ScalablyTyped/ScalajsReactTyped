      * A litmus test that may help a service implementor in deciding
      * between FAILED_PRECONDITION, ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE:
      *  (a) Use UNAVAILABLE if the client can retry just the failing call.

      *  (c) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client should not retry until
      *      the system state has been explicitly fixed. E.g., if an "rmdir"
      *      fails because the directory is non-empty, FAILED_PRECONDITION
      *      should be returned since the client should not retry unless
      *      they have first fixed up the directory by deleting files from it.
      *  (d) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client performs conditional
      *      REST Get/Update/Delete on a resource and the resource on the
      *      server does not match the condition. E.g., conflicting
      *      read-modify-write on the same resource.
