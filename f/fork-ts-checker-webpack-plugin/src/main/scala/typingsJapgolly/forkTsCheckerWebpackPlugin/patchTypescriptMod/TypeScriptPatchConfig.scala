    * If this plugin is running with `checkSyntacticErrors: false`, this might lead to situations where no syntactic errors are reported within webpack
    * (because the file causing a syntactic error might not get processed by ts-loader), but there are semantic errors that would be missed due to this behavior.
    * This ensures that the compilerHost always assumes that there were no syntactic errors to be found and continues to check for semantic errors.
