  /**
    * Checks whether `version` satisfies the `range` specification.
    *
    * We support a subset of the expressions defined in
    * https://www.npmjs.org/doc/misc/semver.html:
    *
    *    version   Must match version exactly
    *    =version  Same as just version
    *    >version  Must be greater than version
    *    >=version Must be greater than or equal to version
    *    <version  Must be less than version
    *    <=version Must be less than or equal to version
    *    ~version  Must be at least version, but less than the next significant
    *              revision above version:
    *              "~1.2.3" is equivalent to ">= 1.2.3 and < 1.3"
    *    ~>version Equivalent to ~version
    *    1.2.x     Must match "1.2.x", where "x" is a wildcard that matches
    *              anything
    *    1.2.*     Similar to "1.2.x", but "*" in the trailing position is a
    *              "greedy" wildcard, so will match any number of additional
    *              components:
    *              "1.2.*" will match "1.2.1", "1.2.1.1", "1.2.1.1.1" etc
    *    *         Any version
    *    ""        (Empty string) Same as *
    *    v1 - v2   Equivalent to ">= v1 and <= v2"
    *    r1 || r2  Passes if either r1 or r2 are satisfied
