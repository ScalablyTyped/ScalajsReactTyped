  * This class holds a collection of writes that can be applied to nodes in unison. It abstracts away the logic with
  * dealing with priority writes and multiple nested writes. At any given path there is only allowed to be one write
  * modifying that path. Any write to an existing path or shadowing an existing path will modify that existing write
  * to reflect the write added.
