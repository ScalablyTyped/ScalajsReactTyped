  /**
    * An `Agent` is responsible for managing connection persistence
    * and reuse for HTTP clients. It maintains a queue of pending requests
    * for a given host and port, reusing a single socket connection for each
    * until the queue is empty, at which time the socket is either destroyed
    * or put into a pool where it is kept to be used again for requests to the
    * same host and port. Whether it is destroyed or pooled depends on the`keepAlive` `option`.
    *
    * Pooled connections have TCP Keep-Alive enabled for them, but servers may
    * still close idle connections, in which case they will be removed from the
    * pool and a new connection will be made when a new HTTP request is made for
    * that host and port. Servers may also refuse to allow multiple requests
    * over the same connection, in which case the connection will have to be
    * remade for every request and cannot be pooled. The `Agent` will still make
    * the requests to that server, but each one will occur over a new connection.
    *
    * When a connection is closed by the client or the server, it is removed
    * from the pool. Any unused sockets in the pool will be unrefed so as not
    * to keep the Node.js process running when there are no outstanding requests.
    * (see `socket.unref()`).
    *
    * It is good practice, to `destroy()` an `Agent` instance when it is no
    * longer in use, because unused sockets consume OS resources.
    *
    * Sockets are removed from an agent when the socket emits either
    * a `'close'` event or an `'agentRemove'` event. When intending to keep one
    * HTTP request open for a long time without keeping it in the agent, something
    * like the following may be done:
    *
    * ```js
    * http.get(options, (res) => {
    *   // Do stuff
    * }).on('socket', (socket) => {
    *   socket.emit('agentRemove');
    * });
    * ```
    *
    * An agent may also be used for an individual request. By providing`{agent: false}` as an option to the `http.get()` or `http.request()`functions, a one-time use `Agent` with default options
    * will be used
    * for the client connection.
    *
    * `agent:false`:
    *
    * ```js
    * http.get({
    *   hostname: 'localhost',
    *   port: 80,
    *   path: '/',
    *   agent: false  // Create a new agent just for this one request
    * }, (res) => {
    *   // Do stuff with response
    * });
    * ```

    * be sent along with the first data chunk or when calling `request.end()`.
    *
    * To get the response, add a listener for `'response'` to the request object.`'response'` will be emitted from the request object when the response

    * ```js

    * });

    * });
    *
    * // Write data to request body
    * req.write(postData);
    * req.end();
    * ```
    *
    * In the example `req.end()` was called. With `http.request()` one
    * must always call `req.end()` to signify the end of the request -
    * even if there is no data being written to the request body.
    *
    * If any error is encountered during the request (be that with DNS resolution,
    * TCP level errors, or actual HTTP parse errors) an `'error'` event is emitted
    * on the returned request object. As with all `'error'` events, if no listeners
    * are registered the error will be thrown.
    *
    * There are a few special headers that should be noted.
    *
    * * Sending a 'Connection: keep-alive' will notify Node.js that the connection to
    * the server should be persisted until the next request.
    * * Sending a 'Content-Length' header will disable the default chunked encoding.
    * * Sending an 'Expect' header will immediately send the request headers.
    * Usually, when sending 'Expect: 100-continue', both a timeout and a listener
    * for the `'continue'` event should be set. See RFC 2616 Section 8.2.3 for more
    * information.
    * * Sending an Authorization header will override using the `auth` option
    * to compute basic authentication.
    *
    * Example using a `URL` as `options`:
    *
    * ```js
    * const options = new URL('http://abc:xyz@example.com');
    *
    * const req = http.request(options, (res) => {
    *   // ...
    * });
    * ```
    *
    * In a successful request, the following events will be emitted in the following
    * order:
    *
    * * `'socket'`
    * * `'response'`
    *    * `'data'` any number of times, on the `res` object
    *    (`'data'` will not be emitted at all if the response body is empty, for
    *    instance, in most redirects)
    *    * `'end'` on the `res` object

    *
    * * `'socket'`
    * * `'error'`
    * * `'close'`
    *
    * In the case of a premature connection close before the response is received,
    * the following events will be emitted in the following order:
    *
    * * `'socket'`
    * * `'error'` with an error with message `'Error: socket hang up'` and code`'ECONNRESET'`

    * * `'close'`
    * * `'close'` on the `res` object
