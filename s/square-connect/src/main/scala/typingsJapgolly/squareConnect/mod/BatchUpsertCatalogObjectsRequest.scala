    * A batch of [CatalogObject](#type-catalogobject)s to be inserted/updated atomically. The objects within a batch
    * will be inserted in an all-or-nothing fashion, i.e., if an error occurs attempting to insert or update an object
    * within a batch, the entire batch will be rejected. However, an error in one batch will not affect other batches
    * within the same request. For each object, its `updated_at` field is ignored and replaced with a current
    * [timestamp](#workingwithdates), and its `is_deleted` field must not be set to `true`. To modify an existing
    * object, supply its ID. To create a new object, use an ID starting with `#`. These IDs may be used to create
    * relationships between an object and attributes of other objects that reference it. For example, you can create a
    * [CatalogItem](#type-catalogitem) with ID `#ABC` and a [CatalogItemVariation](#type-catalogitemvariation) with its
    * `item_id` attribute set to `#ABC` in order to associate the [CatalogItemVariation](#type-catalogitemvariation)
    * with its parent [CatalogItem](#type-catalogitem). Any `#`-prefixed IDs are valid only within a single atomic
    * batch, and will be replaced by server-generated IDs. Each batch may contain up to 1,000 objects. The total
    * number of objects across all batches for a single request may not exceed 10,000. If either of these limits is
    * violated, an error will be returned and no objects will be inserted or updated.
