      * In addition, Sass indices refer to Unicode code points while JavaScript
      * string indices refer to UTF-16 code units. For example, the character

      * `string.slice("nðŸ˜Šb", 1, 1)` returns `"ðŸ˜Š"`.

      * indices. This means it's O(n) in the length of `text`.

      * integer, or if that integer isn't a valid index for this string.
