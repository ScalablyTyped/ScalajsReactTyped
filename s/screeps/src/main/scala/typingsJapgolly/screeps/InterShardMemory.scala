  * `InterShardMemory` object provides an interface for communicating between shards.
  * Your script is executed separatedly on each shard, and their `Memory` objects are isolated from each other.
  * In order to pass messages and data between shards, you need to use `InterShardMemory` instead.
  *
  * Every shard can have its own data string that can be accessed by all other shards.
  * A shard can write only to its own data, other shards' data is read-only.
  *
  * This data has nothing to do with `Memory` contents, it's a separate data container.
