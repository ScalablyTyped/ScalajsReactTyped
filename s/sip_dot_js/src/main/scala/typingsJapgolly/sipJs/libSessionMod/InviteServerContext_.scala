    * is sent prior to the "invite" event being emitted, it's a known
    * issue that the ISC user cannot register listeners or do any other
    * setup prior to the call to `progress()`. As an example why this is
    * an issue, setting `ua.configuration.rel100` to REQUIRED will result
    * in an attempt by `progress()` to send a 183 with SDP produced by
    * calling `getDescription()` on a session description handler, but
    * the ISC user cannot perform any potentially required session description
    * handler initialization (thus preventing the utilization of setting
    * `ua.configuration.rel100` to REQUIRED). That begs the question of
    * why this behavior is disabled when the UAC requires 100rel but not
    * when the UAS requires 100rel? But ignoring that, it's just one example
    * of a class of cases where the ISC user needs to do something prior
    * to the first call to `progress()` and is unable to do so.
