  /**
    * Registration of event listeners.
    *
    * The following events are emitted...
    *  - "accepted" A 200-class final response to a SUBSCRIBE request was received.
    *  - "failed" A non-200-class final response to a SUBSCRIBE request was received.
    *  - "rejected" Emitted immediately after a "failed" event (yes, it's redundant).
    *  - "notify" A NOTIFY request was received.
    *  - "terminated" The subscription is moving to or has moved to a terminated state.
    *
    * More than one SUBSCRIBE request may be sent, so "accepted", "failed" and "rejected"
    * may be emitted multiple times. However these event will NOT be emitted for SUBSCRIBE
    * requests with expires of zero (unsubscribe requests).
    *
    * Note that a "terminated" event does NOT indicate the subscription is in the "terminated"
    * state as described in RFC 6665. Instead, a "terminated" event indicates that this class
    * is no longer usable and/or is in the process of becoming no longer usable.
    *
    * The order the events are emitted in is not deterministic. Some examples...
    *  - "accepted" may occur multiple times
    *  - "accepted" may follow "notify" and "notify" may follow "accepted"
    *  - "terminated" may follow "accepted" and "accepted" may follow "terminated"
    *  - "terminated" may follow "notify" and "notify" may follow "terminated"
    *
    * Hint: Experience suggests one workable approach to utilizing these events
    * is to make use of "notify" and "terminated" only. That is, call `subscribe()`
    * and if a "notify" occurs then you have a subscription. If a "terminated"
    * event occurs then either a new subscription failed to be established or an
    * established subscription has terminated or is in the process of terminating.
    * Note that "notify" events may follow a "terminated" event, but experience
    * suggests it is reasonable to discontinue usage of this class after receipt
    * of a "terminated" event. The other events are informational, but as they do not
    * arrive in a deterministic manner it is difficult to make use of them otherwise.
    *
    * @param name Event name.
    * @param callback Callback.
