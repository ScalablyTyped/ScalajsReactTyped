/**
  * A collection of properties related to deferrable constraints. It can be used to
  * make foreign key constraints deferrable and to set the constaints within a
  * transaction. This is only supported in PostgreSQL.
  *
  * The foreign keys can be configured like this. It will create a foreign key
  * that will check the constraints immediately when the data was inserted.
  *
  * ```js
  * sequelize.define('Model', {
  *   foreign_id: {
  *     type: Sequelize.INTEGER,
  *     references: {
  *       model: OtherModel,
  *       key: 'id',
  *       deferrable: Sequelize.Deferrable.INITIALLY_IMMEDIATE
  *     }
  *   }
  * });
  * ```
  *
  * The constraints can be configured in a transaction like this. It will
  * trigger a query once the transaction has been started and set the constraints
  * to be checked at the very end of the transaction.
  *
  * ```js
  * sequelize.transaction({
  *   deferrable: Sequelize.Deferrable.SET_DEFERRED
  * });
  * ```
