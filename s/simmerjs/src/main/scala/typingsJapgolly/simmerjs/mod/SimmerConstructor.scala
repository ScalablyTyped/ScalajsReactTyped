  * should provide the Window object of the Virtual DOM
  * @param options Options object allowing you to override the default
  * configuration for Simmer's behaviour.
  * @param query A query engine you wish Simmer to use when evaluating
  * generated selectors. By default Simmer uses the
  * `window.document.querySelectorAll` function and if you provide a window
  * to the scope, Simmer will assume that you want it to use the
  * `document.querySelectorAll` on that window. But if you wish Simmer to use
  * another custom function, such as your own tweaked version of jQuery, you
  * can do so by passing the third argument to the Simmer constructor.
