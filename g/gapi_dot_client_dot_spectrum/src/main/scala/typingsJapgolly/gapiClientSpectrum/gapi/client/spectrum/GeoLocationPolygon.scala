    * When the geolocation describes a region, the exterior field refers to a list of latitude/longitude points that represent the vertices of a polygon. The
    * first and last points must be the same. Thus, a minimum of four points is required. The following polygon restrictions from RFC5491 apply:
    * - A connecting line shall not cross another connecting line of the same polygon.
    * - The vertices must be defined in a counterclockwise order.
    * - The edges of a polygon are defined by the shortest path between two points in space (not a geodesic curve). Consequently, the length between two
    * adjacent vertices should be restricted to a maximum of 130 km.
    * - All vertices are assumed to be at the same altitude.
    * - Polygon shapes should be restricted to a maximum of 15 vertices (16 points that include the repeated vertex).
