    * detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. &#42;
    * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. &#42; skipLeadingRows = N > 0 -
    * Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract
    * column names for the detected schema.
