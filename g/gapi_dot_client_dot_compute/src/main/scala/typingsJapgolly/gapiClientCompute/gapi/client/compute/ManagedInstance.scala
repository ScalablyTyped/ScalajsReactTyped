    * [Output Only] The current action that the managed instance group has scheduled for the instance. Possible values:
    * - NONE The instance is running, and the managed instance group does not have any scheduled actions for this instance.
    * - CREATING The managed instance group is creating this instance. If the group fails to create this instance, it will try again until it is successful.
    * - CREATING_WITHOUT_RETRIES The managed instance group is attempting to create this instance only once. If the group fails to create this instance, it
    * does not try again and the group's targetSize value is decreased instead.
    * - RECREATING The managed instance group is recreating this instance.
    * - DELETING The managed instance group is permanently deleting this instance.
    * - ABANDONING The managed instance group is abandoning this instance. The instance will be removed from the instance group and from any target pools
    * that are associated with this group.
    * - RESTARTING The managed instance group is restarting the instance.
    * - REFRESHING The managed instance group is applying configuration changes to the instance without stopping it. For example, the group can update the
    * target pool list for an instance without stopping that instance.
