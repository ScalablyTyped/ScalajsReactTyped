    *  - The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return,
    *    and the order in which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language,
    *    such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be valid in one language but not in another.

    *  - If you pass an address, the service geocodes the string and converts it to a latitude/longitude coordinate to calculate distance.
    *    This coordinate may be different from that returned by the Geocoding API, for example a building entrance rather than its center.
    *
    *    `origins=Bobcaygeon+ON|24+Sussex+Drive+Ottawa+ON`

    *    You can only specify a place ID if the request includes an API key or a Google Maps APIs Premium Plan client ID.

    *    This is particularly useful if you have a large number of origin points, because the URL is significantly shorter when using
    *    an encoded polyline.
