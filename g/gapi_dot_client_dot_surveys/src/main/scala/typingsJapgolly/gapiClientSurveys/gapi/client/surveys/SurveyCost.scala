    * the final computed cost per response. If the survey has no threshold_answers, setting this property will return an error. By specifying this property,
    * you indicate the max price per response you are willing to pay in advance of the incidence test. If the price turns out to be lower than the specified
    * value, the survey will begin immediately and you will be charged at the rate determined by the incidence pricing test. If the price turns out to be
    * greater than the specified value the survey will not be started and you will instead be notified what price was determined by the incidence test. At
    * that point, you must raise the value of this property to be greater than or equal to that cost before attempting to start the survey again. This will
    * immediately start the survey as long the incidence test was run within the last 21 days.
