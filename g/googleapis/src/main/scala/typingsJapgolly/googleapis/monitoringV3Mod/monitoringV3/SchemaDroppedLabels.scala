/**
  * A set of (label, value) pairs which were dropped during aggregation,
  * attached to google.api.Distribution.Exemplars in google.api.Distribution
  * values during aggregation.These values are used in combination with the
  * label values that remain on the aggregated Distribution timeseries to
  * construct the full label set for the exemplar values. The resulting full
  * label set may be used to identify the specific task/job/instance (for
  * example) which may be contributing to a long-tail, while allowing the
  * storage savings of only storing aggregated distribution values for a large
  * group.Note that there are no guarantees on ordering of the labels from
  * exemplar-to-exemplar and from distribution-to-distribution in the same
  * stream, and there may be duplicates. It is up to clients to resolve any
  * ambiguities.
