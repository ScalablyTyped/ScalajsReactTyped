    * coordinate system the object might be laid out such that the base of the
    * tower is on the YZ plane and the tip of the tower is towards positive X.
    * In this case this quaternion would specify a rotation (of 90 degrees
    * about the Z axis) such that in the presentation space the base of the
    * tower is aligned with the XZ plane, and the tip of the tower lies towards
    * +Y.  This rotation is unrelated to the object&#39;s pose in the web
    * preview, which is just a camera position setting and is *not* reflected
    * in this rotation.  Please note: this is applicable only to the gLTF.
