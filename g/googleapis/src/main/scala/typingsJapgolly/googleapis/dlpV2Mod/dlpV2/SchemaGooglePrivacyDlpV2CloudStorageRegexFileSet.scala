/**
  * Message representing a set of files in a Cloud Storage bucket. Regular
  * expressions are used to allow fine-grained control over which files in the
  * bucket to include.  Included files are those that match at least one item
  * in `include_regex` and do not match any items in `exclude_regex`. Note that
  * a file that matches items from both lists will _not_ be included. For a
  * match to occur, the entire file path (i.e., everything in the url after the
  * bucket name) must match the regular expression.  For example, given the
  * input `{bucket_name: &quot;mybucket&quot;, include_regex:
  * [&quot;directory1/.*&quot;], exclude_regex:
  * [&quot;directory1/excluded.*&quot;]}`:  * `gs://mybucket/directory1/myfile`
  * will be included * `gs://mybucket/directory1/directory2/myfile` will be
  * included (`.*` matches across `/`) *
  * `gs://mybucket/directory0/directory1/myfile` will _not_ be included (the
  * full path doesn&#39;t match any items in `include_regex`) *
  * `gs://mybucket/directory1/excludedfile` will _not_ be included (the path
  * matches an item in `exclude_regex`)  If `include_regex` is left empty, it
  * will match all files by default (this is equivalent to setting
  * `include_regex: [&quot;.*&quot;]`).  Some other common use cases:  *
  * `{bucket_name: &quot;mybucket&quot;, exclude_regex: [&quot;.*\.pdf&quot;]}`
  * will include all files in `mybucket` except for .pdf files * `{bucket_name:
  * &quot;mybucket&quot;, include_regex: [&quot;directory/[^/]+&quot;]}` will
  * include all files directly under `gs://mybucket/directory/`, without
  * matching across `/`
