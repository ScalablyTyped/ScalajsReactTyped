  * necessarily all at once, to the database schema at some point (or points)
  * in the future. The server checks that the statements are executable
  * (syntactically valid, name tables that exist, etc.) before enqueueing them,
  * but they may still fail upon later execution (e.g., if a statement from
  * another batch of statements is applied first and it conflicts in some way,
  * or if there is some data-related problem like a `NULL` value in a column to
  * which `NOT NULL` would be added). If a statement fails, all subsequent
  * statements in the batch are automatically cancelled.  Each batch of
  * statements is assigned a name which can be used with the Operations API to
  * monitor progress. See the operation_id field for more details.
