/**
  * The response for ExecuteBatchDml. Contains a list of ResultSet, one for
  * each DML statement that has successfully executed. If a statement fails,
  * the error is returned as part of the response payload. Clients can
  * determine whether all DML statements have run successfully, or if a
  * statement failed, using one of the following approaches:    1. Check if
  * &#39;status&#39; field is OkStatus.   2. Check if result_sets_size() equals
  * the number of statements in      ExecuteBatchDmlRequest.  Example 1: A
  * request with 5 DML statements, all executed successfully. Result: A
  * response with 5 ResultSets, one for each statement in the same order, and
  * an OK status.  Example 2: A request with 5 DML statements. The 3rd
  * statement has a syntax error. Result: A response with 2 ResultSets, for the
  * first 2 statements that run successfully, and a syntax error
  * (INVALID_ARGUMENT) status. From result_set_size() client can determine that
  * the 3rd statement has failed.
