    * you plan to use labels in your own code, please note that additional
    * characters may be allowed in the future. And so you are advised to use an
    * internal label representation, such as JSON, which doesn&#39;t rely upon
    * specific characters being disallowed.  For example, representing labels
    * as the string:  name + &quot;_&quot; + value  would prove problematic if
