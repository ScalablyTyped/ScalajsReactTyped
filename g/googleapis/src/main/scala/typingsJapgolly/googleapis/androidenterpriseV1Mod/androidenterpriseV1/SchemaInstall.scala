/**
  * The existence of an Installs resource indicates that an app is installed on
  * a particular device (or that an install is pending).  The API can be used
  * to create an install resource using the update method. This triggers the
  * actual install of the app on the device. If the user does not already have
  * an entitlement for the app, then an attempt is made to create one. If this
  * fails (for example, because the app is not free and there is no available
  * license), then the creation of the install fails.  The API can also be used
  * to update an installed app. If the update method is used on an existing
  * install, then the app will be updated to the latest available version. Note
  * that it is not possible to force the installation of a specific version of
  * an app: the version code is read-only.  If a user installs an app
  * themselves (as permitted by the enterprise), then again an install resource
  * and possibly an entitlement resource are automatically created.  The API
  * can also be used to delete an install resource, which triggers the removal
  * of the app from the device. Note that deleting an install does not
  * automatically remove the corresponding entitlement, even if there are no
  * remaining installs. The install resource will also be deleted if the user
  * uninstalls the app themselves.
