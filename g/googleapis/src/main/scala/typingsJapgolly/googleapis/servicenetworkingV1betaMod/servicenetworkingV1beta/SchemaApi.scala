/**
  * Api is a light-weight descriptor for an API Interface.  Interfaces are also
  * described as &quot;protocol buffer services&quot; in some contexts, such as
  * by the &quot;service&quot; keyword in a .proto file, but they are different
  * from API Services, which represent a concrete implementation of an
  * interface as opposed to simply a description of methods and bindings. They
  * are also sometimes simply referred to as &quot;APIs&quot; in other
  * contexts, such as the name of this message itself. See
  * https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/glossary for detailed terminology.

    * field is not empty, the version in the package name will be verified to

    * [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) where the major version number
    * indicates a breaking change and the minor version an additive,
    * non-breaking change. Both version numbers are signals to users what to
    * expect from different versions, and should be carefully chosen based on
    * the product plan.  The major version is also reflected in the package
    * name of the interface, which must end in `v&lt;major-version&gt;`, as in
    * `google.feature.v1`. For major versions 0 and 1, the suffix can be
    * omitted. Zero major versions must only be used for experimental, non-GA
    * interfaces.
