/**
  * A collection of Ranges with the same named range ID.  Named ranges allow
  * developers to associate parts of a document with an arbitrary user-defined
  * label so their contents can be programmatically read or edited at a later
  * time. A document can contain multiple named ranges with the same name, but
  * every named range has a unique ID.  A named range is created with a single
  * Range, and content inserted inside a named range generally expands that
  * range. However, certain document changes can cause the range to be split
  * into multiple ranges.  Named ranges are not private. All applications and
  * collaborators that have access to the document can see its named ranges.
