/**
  * Alternative identifier for a course.  An alias uniquely identifies a
  * course. It must be unique within one of the following scopes:  * domain: A
  * domain-scoped alias is visible to all users within the alias creator&#39;s
  * domain and can be created only by a domain admin. A domain-scoped alias is
  * often used when a course has an identifier external to Classroom.  *
  * project: A project-scoped alias is visible to any request from an
  * application using the Developer Console project ID that created the alias
  * and can be created by any project. A project-scoped alias is often used
  * when an application has alternative identifiers. A random value can also be
  * used to avoid duplicate courses in the event of transmission failures, as
  * retrying a request will return `ALREADY_EXISTS` if a previous one has
  * succeeded.
