/**
  * Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments
  * addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a
  * premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical
  * locations (roads, towns, mountains).  In typical usage an address would be
  * created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the
  * type of process.  Advice on address input / editing:  - Use an i18n-ready
  * address widget such as    https://github.com/googlei18n/libaddressinput) -
  * Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of
  * fields outside countries where that field is used.  For more guidance on
  * how to use this schema, please see:

    * Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may
    * sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin,
    * TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of
    * address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region
    * of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan),
    * address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for
    * large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for
    * small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be
    * selected based on the language.  The minimum permitted structural
    * representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining
    * information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format
    * such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic
    * reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was
    * at least partially resolved.  Creating an address only containing a
    * region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way
    * to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which
    * parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).
