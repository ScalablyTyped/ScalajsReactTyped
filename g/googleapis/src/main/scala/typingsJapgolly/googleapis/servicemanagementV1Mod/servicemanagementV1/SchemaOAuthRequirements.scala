/**
  * OAuth scopes are a way to define data and permissions on data. For example,
  * there are scopes defined for &quot;Read-only access to Google
  * Calendar&quot; and &quot;Access to Cloud Platform&quot;. Users can consent
  * to a scope for an application, giving it permission to access that data on
  * their behalf.  OAuth scope specifications should be fairly coarse grained;
  * a user will need to see and understand the text description of what your
  * scope means.  In most cases: use one or at most two OAuth scopes for an
  * entire family of products. If your product has multiple APIs, you should
  * probably be sharing the OAuth scope across all of those APIs.  When you
  * need finer grained OAuth consent screens: talk with your product management
  * about how developers will use them in practice.  Please note that even
  * though each of the canonical scopes is enough for a request to be accepted
  * and passed to the backend, a request can still fail due to the backend
  * requiring additional scopes or permissions.
