    * Creates an ad schedule criterion from an ad schedule object. Once created, the campaign will start showing ads during the specified time.
    *
    * When called with one argument, addAdSchedule supports two kinds of input:
    *
    * Existing AdSchedule objects, perhaps from another campaign:
    *
    *      var campaigns = AdsApp.campaigns().get();
    *      var campaign1 = campaigns.next();
    *      var campaign2 = campaigns.next();
    *      var schedule = campaign1.targeting().adSchedules().get().next();
    *      campaign2.addAdSchedule(schedule);
    *
    * Plain JavaScript objects describing an ad schedule. For instance, this will create an ad schedule covering Saturday mornings:
    *
    *      var campaign = AdsApp.campaigns().get().next();
    *      campaign.addAdSchedule({
    *        dayOfWeek: "SATURDAY",
    *        startHour: 7,
    *        startMinute: 0,
    *        endHour: 11,
    *        endMinute: 0,
    *        bidModifier: 1.1
    *      });
    *
    * This will look at the following properties of the given object:
    *
    * - `dayOfWeek`: **Required**. Must be one of `"MONDAY"`, `"TUESDAY"`, `"WEDNESDAY"`, `"THURSDAY"`, `"FRIDAY"`, `"SATURDAY"`, or `"SUNDAY"`.
    * - `startHour` and `startMinute`: **Required**. The starting time of this segment of the ad schedule. `startHour` must be an integer between 0 and 23,
    * and `startMinute` must be either 0, 15, 30, or 45. For instance, a `startHour` of 18 and a `startMinute` of 30 would result in an ad schedule starting at 6:30PM.
    * Acceptable starting times range from 00:00 to 23:45.
    * - `endHour` and `endMinute`: **Required**. The ending time of this segment of the ad schedule. `endHour` must be an integer between 0 and 24, and `endMinute` must
    * be either 0, 15, 30, or 45. For instance, a `endHour` of 18 and a `endMinute` of 30 would result in an ad schedule ending at 6:30PM. Acceptable ending times rang
    * from 00:15 to 24:00.
    * - `bidModifier`: **Optional**. The bid modifier for this segment of the ad schedule.
    *
    * One thing to keep in mind is that, by default, campaigns have no ad schedule criteria and hence serve ads at all times.
    * Adding the first ad schedule to a campaign will cause ads to be shown during that time only.
    *
    * There is a limit of 6 ad schedules for each day of the week — for instance, splitting up each day into 6 4-hour-long periods is supported,
    * but splitting up each day into 24 1-hour-long periods is not.
