    * Cloud Labels are a flexible and lightweight mechanism for organizing cloud

    * resources. They can be used to control how resource metrics are aggregated.
    * And they can be used as arguments to policy management rules (e.g. route,
    * firewall, load balancing, etc.).
    *
    * &#42; Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to
    * the following regular expression: `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]&#42;[a-z0-9])?`.
    * &#42; Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform
    * to the regular expression `([a-z]([-a-z0-9]&#42;[a-z0-9])?)?`.
    * &#42; No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given resource.
    *
    * See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and examples of labels.
    *
    * If you plan to use labels in your own code, please note that additional
    * characters may be allowed in the future. And so you are advised to use an
    * internal label representation, such as JSON, which doesn't rely upon
    * specific characters being disallowed.  For example, representing labels
    * as the string:  name + "_" + value  would prove problematic if we were to
    * allow "_" in a future release.
