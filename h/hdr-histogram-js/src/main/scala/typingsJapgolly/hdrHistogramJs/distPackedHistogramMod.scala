    * <h3>A High Dynamic Range (HDR) Histogram that uses a packed internal representation</h3>
    * <p>
    * {@link PackedHistogram} supports the recording and analyzing sampled data value counts across a configurable
    * integer value range with configurable value precision within the range. Value precision is expressed as the
    * number of significant digits in the value recording, and provides control over value quantization behavior
    * across the value range and the subsequent value resolution at any given level.
    * <p>
    * {@link PackedHistogram} tracks value counts in a packed internal representation optimized
    * for typical histogram recoded values are sparse in the value range and tend to be incremented in small unit counts.
    * This packed representation tends to require significantly smaller amounts of stoarge when compared to unpacked
    * representations, but can incur additional recording cost due to resizing and repacking operations that may
    * occur as previously unrecorded values are encountered.
    * <p>
    * For example, a {@link PackedHistogram} could be configured to track the counts of observed integer values between 0 and
    * 3,600,000,000,000 while maintaining a value precision of 3 significant digits across that range. Value quantization
    * within the range will thus be no larger than 1/1,000th (or 0.1%) of any value. This example Histogram could
    * be used to track and analyze the counts of observed response times ranging between 1 nanosecond and 1 hour
    * in magnitude, while maintaining a value resolution of 1 microsecond up to 1 millisecond, a resolution of
    * 1 millisecond (or better) up to one second, and a resolution of 1 second (or better) up to 1,000 seconds. At its
    * maximum tracked value (1 hour), it would still maintain a resolution of 3.6 seconds (or better).
    * <p>
    * Auto-resizing: When constructed with no specified value range range (or when auto-resize is turned on with {@link
    * Histogram#setAutoResize}) a {@link PackedHistogram} will auto-resize its dynamic range to include recorded values as
    * they are encountered. Note that recording calls that cause auto-resizing may take longer to execute, as resizing
    * incurs allocation and copying of internal data structures.
