sealed trait Events extends js.Object

/** If the job includes a callback URL, a comma-separated list of notification events to which to subscribe. Valid events are * `recognitions.started` generates a callback notification when the service begins to process the job. * `recognitions.completed` generates a callback notification when the job is complete. You must use the **Check a job** method to retrieve the results before they time out or are deleted. * `recognitions.completed_with_results` generates a callback notification when the job is complete. The notification includes the results of the request. * `recognitions.failed` generates a callback notification if the service experiences an error while processing the job. The `recognitions.completed` and `recognitions.completed_with_results` events are incompatible. You can specify only of the two events. If the job includes a callback URL, omit the parameter to subscribe to the default events: `recognitions.started`, `recognitions.completed`, and `recognitions.failed`. If the job does not include a callback URL, omit the parameter. */
