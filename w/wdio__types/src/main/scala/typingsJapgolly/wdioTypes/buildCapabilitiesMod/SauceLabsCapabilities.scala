    * - __public restricted__: If you want to share your job's result page and video, but keep

    *   that it is only accessible to people having valid link and it is not listed on publicly available
    *   pages on saucelabs.com or indexed by search engines.
    * - __team__: If you want to share your jobs with other team members (that were created as a sub-accounts
    *   of one parent account), you can use team visibility mode. Making your test accessible by team means
    *   that it is only accessible to people under the same root account as you.
    * - __private__: If you don't want to share your test's result page and video with anyone, you should
    *   use private job visibility mode. This way, only you (the owner) will be able to view assets and test
    *   result page.
